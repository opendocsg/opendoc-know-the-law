# Courts of Law

The Singapore Court System consists of two tiers:

1.  State Courts; and

2.  Supreme Court.

## Jurisdiction of the Courts

The amount of your claim will determine which court you should commence
your action in.

The table below sets out the general jurisdiction of the respective
courts. Do note that the law provides exceptions in some circumstances.

## STATE COURTS

The District Courts and Magistrate Courts hear both civil and criminal
cases.

### Coroner’s Court

The Coroner’s Court holds inquiries to determine the cause of a person’s
death. Such inquiries are held when there is reason to suspect that a
person has died in a sudden or unnatural manner, by violence, when the
cause of death is unknown or where required by the law.

### Community Court

The Community Court deals with special cases involving community
resources and criminal justice. Beyond deterrence and retribution, the
Community Court emphasizes rehabilitation and prevention by adopting a
problem-solving approach and exploring alternatives to traditional
punitive sentences (e.g. imprisonment and fines) for minor offences.

Cases that are heard by the Community Court include:

-   Youthful offenders (aged 16 to 18) and certain offences committed by
    those under 21;

-   Select cases involving offenders with mental disabilities;

-   Attempted suicide cases;

-   Family violence cases;

-   Abuse and cruelty to animals;

-   Cases that impact race relations issues;

-   Select cases involving offenders aged 65 years and above;

-   Select cases involving accused persons with chronic addiction
    problems; and

-   Shop theft cases.

### Night Court

The concept of Night Courts was established to deal with the high volume
of regulatory and traffic offences that are heard at the State Courts.
These courts function for the convenience of the working public who
would otherwise have to take time off from work in order to attend
court. The operating hours are from 6.00pm onwards on Mondays to
Thursdays.

There are two Night Courts in the State Courts complex, each hearing a
specific profile of cases.

-   Court 26N deals with summonses and notices issued by the various
    government departments, such as the Housing and Development Board,
    the Urban Redevelopment Authority, Central Provident Fund Board, and
    the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.

-   Court 25N deals primarily with road traffic offences brought to
    court by the Traffic Police and regulatory offences brought to court
    by the Land Transport Authority.

### Small Claims Tribunals (“SCT”)

The SCT handles claims below S$10,000 (or S$20,000 if both parties agree
and file a Memorandum of Consent online).

It is meant to provide a less formal and cheaper procedure to resolve
such claims. Parties are not allowed to be represented by a lawyer at
the SCT.

#### Types of Claim

You may personally file a claim with the SCT if it arises from one of
the following:

-   a sale or purchase of goods;

-   the provision of services (e.g. repairs or renovation works);

-   tortious damage to property (but not including damage arising
    because of a motor vehicle accident); or

-   any contact relating to a lease of residential property for a period
    of less than two years.

If you wish to file your claim at the SCT, you must do so within one
year from the date of the incident that you are complaining of.

#### SCT Procedure

A brief overview of the procedure is set out in the flowchart below:

Before filing your claim, you should take an online pre-filing
assessment available on the State Court’s website to assess if your
claim can be heard by the SCT. However, do note that the test is not
conclusive and you should consult a lawyer if you are unsure whether
your claim falls within the jurisdiction of the SCT.

From 10 July 2017, you are required to submit your claims online through
an electronic case filing and management system called the Community
Justice and Tribunals System (“CJTS”). CJTS allows parties involved in
disputes to file claims and access Court e-services from any place with
Internet connection.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Whether you are the Claimant or Respondent, if you wish to settle the
claim, you may initiate e-Negotiation process to resolve the dispute
without having to attend Court in person.

-   Claimants and Respondents are allowed to make three offers in the
    negotiation to reach a settlement.

-   If parties manage to reach to settlement on the e-Negotiation
    platform, they may apply to have the agreed terms recorded as a
    consent order by clicking “Request for Order of Tribunal”. Note that
    this is subject to approval.

-   Alternatively, if parties are able to resolve the dispute on their
    own, the Claimant may withdraw the claim by submitting the
    “Withdrawal Request Form” in CJTS. Once the claim is withdrawn, the
    matter ends.

-   If no settlement is reached, or if the application for consent order
    is not rejected, parties are to attend the Consultation in Court.

At the Consultation, the Registrar will determine if the claim can be
heard by the SCT. If so, the Registrar will mediate the claim and assist
the parties in resolving the dispute. Parties must attend the
Consultation. Otherwise, an adverse order may be made against the absent
party – if the Claimant does not turn up, his/her claim may be
dismissed; if the Respondent does not turn up, a default judgment may be
entered against him/her.

If a claim is not settled at the consultation before the Registrar, it
will generally be fixed for hearing before a judge (“Referee”). The
Referee will also explore the possibility of settling the claim before
adjudicating on it. An order made by the Referee is binding and has the
same force and effect as an order of the Magistrate’s Court.

#### Lodgement Fees

The lodgement fees to file a claim at SCT are as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th><strong>Not exceeding $5,000</strong></th>
<th><strong>Exceeding $5,000 but not exceeding $10,000 </strong></th>

</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td>3% of claimed amount</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Appeal to the High Court

You may appeal against decisions of the SCT to the High Court on points
of law or jurisdiction and you can engage a lawyer to represent you from
this point. You (or your lawyer) will first have to apply to the
District Judge for leave (i.e. permission) to appeal within 14 days of
the Referee’s Order. For claims filed on or after 10 July 2017, you may
make the application for leave to appeal online via CTJS by completing
the “Application for Leave to Appeal” form.

If the District Judge grants you Leave to Appeal, you can then file a
Notice of Appeal to the High Court. This Notice of Appeal must be filed
within one month of the District Judge’s order granting leave for you to
appeal.

Common fees for the appeal are as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Application to District Court (DC) for leave to appeal </th>
<th><strong>S$100</strong></th>

### Family Justice Courts

The Family Justice Courts comprise the Family Division of the High
Court, the Family Courts and the Youth Courts.

The Family Justice Courts hear all family-related cases, including:

-   Divorce and related matters, such as maintenance (financial
    support), division of matrimonial assets, custody of children;

-   Domestic violence cases, Personal Protection Orders and in certain
    circumstances, Domestic Exclusion Orders to prevent the abuser from
    entering the home;

-   Adoption and guardianship cases;

-   Juvenile cases;

-   Applications for deputyship under the Mental Capacity Act; and

-   Probate matters (wills, trusts and estates).

### Syariah Court

The Syariah Court hears claims relating to Muslim family matters, such
as Muslim marriages, divorces, and inheritance. Persons who are married
under Muslim law and have disputes relating to their marriage can have
their case heard under this Court. It is also the only Court that can
issue an inheritance certificate for Muslim probate matters (wills,
trusts and estates).

## SUPREME COURT

The Supreme Court consists of the High Court and the Court of Appeal.

### High Court

The High Court exercises original and appellate jurisdiction in civil
and criminal cases. This means that it has the right to hear cases in
the first instance as well as the right to hear cases on appeal from the
State Courts. Generally, except for most probate matters (wills, trusts
and estates), a civil case is commenced in the High Court if the value
of the claim is above $250,000. Probate matters take place in the High
Court only if the deceased’s estate is above $3,000,000, or if the case
involves the resealing of a foreign grant.

In criminal cases, the High Court has the power to try all cases. In
general, the High Court tries cases where the offences are punishable
with death or with imprisonment for a term that exceeds 10 years. The
High Court has the power to pass any sentence allowed by law.

The High Court can also hear points of law in special cases submitted by
a District Court or Magistrate’s Court. The High Court can reverse
decisions from the State Courts, or ask the State Courts to conduct a
new trial on the matter.

### Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal hears appeals of decisions on civil and criminal
cases from the High Court. The Court of Appeal is presided over by the
Chief Justice, and in his absence, a Judge of Appeal or a Judge of the
High Court. The Court of Appeal is usually made up of three Judges but
certain appeals may be heard by only two Judges. If necessary, the Court
of Appeal may comprise five or any greater uneven number of Judges.

**PART II CIVIL CLAIMS**

**Civil Procedure **

**CIVIL CASES**

***Different Claim Amounts, Different Courts ***

The amount of the claim (e.g. for damages for breach of contract,
negligence etc.) will determine which court the action is commenced in:

-   Magistrates’ Court – up to $60,000;

-   District Court –$60,000 to $250,000;

-   High Court – above $250,000.

For example, if your motor vehicle was totally damaged by another
vehicle in a road motor accident, the amount of the claim (compensation)
will be based on the total sum of the value of your motor vehicle as
well as other losses, such as the cost of renting a motor vehicle. If
the total sum is $75,000, you should commence your claim in the District
Court.

The law does not require you to be represented by a lawyer unless you
are a corporate entity (e.g. a private limited company).

*Please note that this is only a general representation of a typical
civil claim; there are many different routes that a claim can take. You
should seek legal advice if you would like to bring a claim, if a claim
has been brought against you, or if you have any other legal inquiries.
*

***Procedure ***

The Flowchart on the next two pages sets out the procedure involved in a
civil case.

Anyone who has a claim (known as the “Plaintiff”) may issue a Writ of
Summons or an Originating Summons and have these legal documents served
(delivered) to the other party (known as the “Defendant”) within the
validity period. A writ is generally valid for six months. Where the
writ has to be served outside of Singapore, it is valid for 12 months.

A writ is served on a defendant by handing a copy of the document to the
defendant if he/she is an individual or leaving it at the registered
address of the defendant if it is a company. There are exceptions, for
example, where the defendant´s solicitor has authority to accept service
on behalf of the defendant or where an order for substituted service is
made.

If the Defendant does not dispute the Plaintiff’s claim, the Defendant
may wish to get in touch with either the Plaintiff or his/her lawyer and
settle the claim immediately. By doing so, both parties would incur less
legal costs.

If the Defendant disputes the claim, the Defendant should consult a
lawyer as soon as possible. If the Defendant is disputing the claim,
he/she has eight days from after service of the writ to file a document
(“Memorandum of Appearance”) in Court to indicate his/her intention to
dispute the claim. If the Defendant has engaged a lawyer, the lawyer
will file the documents on his/her behalf. Alternatively, the Defendant
may attend the Registry of the appropriate Court to seek assistance on
how to do this.

Refusing to acknowledge the delivery of a Writ of Summons or Originating
Summons when it is served does not make the service of the document
invalid. It also does not prevent the Plaintiff from proceeding further.

Once the Writ of Summons or Originating Summons is successfully served,
after eight days the Plaintiff can proceed to obtain an Order of Court
or judgment to compel the Defendant to pay up the amount claimed if the
Defendant does not file a Memorandum of Appearance in time.

The Defendant must subsequently file his/her Defence to the claim in
Court after filing the Memorandum of Appearance and also serve a copy of
the Defence to the Plaintiff’s lawyers at their office address (or the
Plaintiff’s own address of service if he/she is acting in person without
a lawyer). The Defendant must file the Defence within 22 days from the
date that he/she was served with the Writ of Summons. If the Defendant
has any Counterclaim against the Plaintiff, the Defendant can also file
a Counterclaim at the same time. Should the Defendant fail to file his
Defence, the Court may make a summary judgment against him/her.

After having sight of the Defence and the Counterclaim (if any), the
Plaintiff must serve the Defendant his/her reply (and Defence to a
Counterclaim, if any) within 14 days after the Defence (and
Counterclaim, if any) has been served to the Plaintiff.

Pleadings/Pre-trials/Trials all the way to obtaining judgment process
has been omitted.

***Appeals ***

Parties may appeal against any decision given by a District Judge or
Magistrate to the High Court. After the High Court issues a decision,
parties may appeal to the Court of Appeal unless the claims are barred
from appeal under the law.

**GENERAL PROCESS OF A CIVIL CLAIM**

**GIVING EVIDENCE AT A CIVIL TRIAL**

***What a witness does ***

As a witness giving evidence in Court, your duty is to truthfully answer
questions put to you by lawyers or the Judge. You should not alter your
evidence to benefit anyone or try to influence the evidence of any other
witness.

***What to wear ***

You are expected to dress neatly and decently. If you want more advice
on what to wear, ask the lawyer who requested you give evidence as a
witness. You may also visit the websites of the State Courts or Supreme
Court of Singapore for more information.

**SUBPOENA**

***What a subpoena is ***

A subpoena is an order that a person attend Court on a specified date
and time to give evidence as a witness. Sometimes, a subpoena requires
the person to produce documents and if so, the subpoena will state which
documents you are required to produce.

***What to do when you receive a subpoena ***

Unless the Court sets aside the subpoena, it is compulsory for you to
attend Court on days ordered by the Court or until the case is
completed. If you fail to attend, you will be guilty of contempt of
Court and may be fined or imprisoned.

You may contact the firm of solicitors that served you the subpoena and
speak to the lawyer to discuss the case. Find out from him/her the type
of questions that you will be asked and the location of the Court
hearing the case. If necessary, arrange to meet the lawyer to discuss
the case.

You may be asked to make a sworn statement of the evidence that you are
to give in Court in the form of an affidavit.

If you have to apply for leave from work and have difficulties, the
lawyer may be able to give you a letter to assist you in obtaining
leave. If the hearing in Court is for more than one day, find out from
the lawyer approximately how many days you are required to attend Court
so that you can make the necessary arrangements to be away from work.

Trials in Court are conducted in English. If you are not comfortable
speaking in English and require an interpreter, inform the lawyer
soonest so that he/she can ensure that an interpreter is made available
on the day of the hearing.

***Evidence-in-chief ***

A witness’s evidence-in-chief in a civil case is usually given in a
written sworn statement, i.e. the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (often
referred to as “AEIC”).

***In Court ***

Usually, witnesses wait outside the courtroom or in a special waiting
room. Prior to giving evidence, you should not discuss the case with
anyone who has witnessed the ongoing proceedings (including other
witnesses who have already given evidence). When it is your turn to give
evidence, the lawyer or a court clerk will call your name. You will be
shown where to stand or sit.

***In the witness box ***

When you enter the witness box, a court official will ask you to affirm
or swear to “tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth”
(if you are a Christian, you will be asked to swear on the Bible).

There are three stages in the giving of evidence from the witness box:

1.  <span class="underline">Examination-in-chief</span>: The lawyer who
    asked you to come to Court will ask you for your full name, address
    and occupation so that everyone in the Court knows who you are. Then
    he will question you. If you have already given a sworn statement,
    i.e. an AEIC, you will be asked to confirm its contents.

2.  <span class="underline">Cross-examination</span>: Lawyers
    representing other parties of the case may then ask you questions.
    The questions may relate to the matters contained in your AEIC. They
    may also refer you to various documents and ask you questions about
    these documents. When the lawyer says “I put it to you that …”, he
    is putting his/her client’s case to you and merely stating his/her
    client’s version of the facts. Do not get upset by this. If you
    disagree, say so.

3.  <span class="underline">Re-examination</span>: The lawyer who asked
    you questions in the examination-in-chief may question you some more
    to clarify matters arising from the cross-examination.

The judge may also question you at any time during the proceedings.

***When you are giving evidence ***

-   Keep calm and speak slowly. This will help you to say exactly what
    you mean. What you say may have to be written down as you say it and
    the Judge will want to make notes, so you can help by speaking
    slowly and clearly to ensure that the Judge is able to record
    evidence.

-   Although the lawyers are asking the questions, you should direct
    your answers to the Judge, and you should address him as “Your
    Honour”.

-   If you do not know the answer to a question, say so. Do not guess.
    You can use “I am not sure”, “I do not know”, or “I cannot remember”
    – depending on the situation.

-   Giving evidence can be a slow and tiring process but try not to get
    bothered. Do not let any question or person irritate you or make you
    angry. They may be trying to get you to say something *they* want
    you to say, instead of letting you say what you want to say. Just
    tell the truth. Do not argue. Do not make jokes.

-   Try to answer questions simply. If you have not heard the question
    clearly, ask for it to be repeated. If you do not understand the
    question, ask for an explanation. If you wish to explain your answer
    in detail, ask the Judge for permission to do so.

-   If you need time to read a document before answering a question, ask
    the Judge for more time.

-   The most important thing is to tell the truth. It is your duty to
    tell the truth. If you lie in Court, you will be charged for telling
    lies in Court (“perjury”) and be fined or imprisoned.

***After giving evidence ***

When you have completed giving evidence, you may leave the witness stand
with the Judge’s permission. However, the Judge may order that you be
recalled as a witness and return to Court to give evidence subsequently.

Do not communicate with other witnesses after giving evidence.

It may be inconvenient for you to give evidence in Court. You may need
to take time off from work or get someone to look after your children.
But society considers your duty as a witness so important that it has
given the Courts the power to require you to attend Court.

Discuss your difficulties with the lawyer who wants you to give evidence
or with your own lawyer. Ask him/her about expenses if it is a concern.

You will be allowed to claim a reasonable sum to recover your expenses
of going to, remaining at, and returning from Court. Remember, by coming
forward as a witness, you are assisting the Court and doing your duty as
a responsible member of society.

Contractual and Tortious Claims

***What is the difference between criminal law, contract law and tort
law?***

There are three main types of law in most countries, including
Singapore. They are:

**Criminal law**

Criminal laws prohibit various types of behaviour that society thinks
are, at least, undesirable and sometimes, totally unacceptable. They
range from very serious crimes such as murder, theft, drug dealing and
bribery, to crimes that some people think are less serious, such as
cheating and drink driving. Punishments for committing a crime in
Singapore range from fines to imprisonment to even the death penalty.

If someone commits a crime against you, you should file a police report.

**Contract law**

Contract law governs our conduct with other people when we enter into an
agreement with them, such as to buy or sell goods or services.

If you enter into a contract with someone and they fail to do what they
are supposed to do under the contract, you might have a right to sue
them for damages for their breach of the contract. You will usually need
to find out from a lawyer if you have any such right.

**Tort law**

Tort law results from each of us having a civil obligation or duty to
the people around us even if we do not have an explicit legal contract
with them, such as the duty not to cause a nuisance to our neighbours
and not to be careless in a way that harms someone else. The breach of
our non-contractual civil obligations is called a “tort”.

If someone breaches their civil obligation to you, you might have a
right to sue them. Again, you will usually need to find out from a
lawyer what rights you might have against them.

**CONTRACT**

***What is a contract?***

You enter into a contract when you reach an agreement with any party
with the intention of creating legal obligations between you and them.
The other party can be either an individual or a company or some other
kind of business entity. There’s no intention of creating legal
obligations when the agreement is purely social or domestic, such as if
you agree to go to a hawker centre with a friend or a friend agrees to
drive your kids to school.

The following rules must be in place for a contract to be enforceable.
In special circumstances there might be additional factors:

-   There must be an exchange of valuable benefits between you and the
    other party: for example, they are a shop that sells goods to you
    and you pay for those goods, or you agree to provide services to the
    other party and they agree to pay you for your services.

-   Both you and the other party must be “legally competent” – in other
    words, you must both be of sound mind and there can’t be something
    else that stops you entering into the contract.

-   Both you and the other person must be entering into the contract
    voluntarily – if a party is forced into entering into a contract it
    might be unenforceable.

-   The contract must be for a purpose that is legal under the laws–
    contracts to fulfill an illegal purpose (such as tax evasion) are
    generally not enforceable.

People who are 18 or older can enter into most types of contracts. For
contracts about land and a few other things, people need to be 21 to
enter into the contract. There are limits on enforcing contracts made by
someone under the age of 18, mentally incapacitated or inebriated
persons.

***Do contracts have to be in writing?***

No, most contracts don’t need to be in writing. You probably enter into
multiple contracts every day without noticing. For example, you enter
into a contract that isn’t in writing when you buy goods from a
convenience shop, wet market or hawker stall, when you call for a gas
bottle to be delivered, or even when you leave something with a service
outlet to get it repaired.

But if there is a dispute and the contract isn’t in writing, it’s
usually hard to prove what the terms of the contract were. For small
transactions it usually doesn’t matter because there’s not much at stake
– if you argue with the shop person and think you’ve been cheated, you
simply don’t go back to that same shop.

Where there is more at stake, such as a contract to get your aircon
serviced or to buy furniture or appliances for your house, you should be
sure that there is a contract and that you read it to understand your
obligations before you sign it.

Some types of contracts must be in writing (or there must be written
evidence of them) and they must be signed by both parties. These
include:

-   Any contract for a transaction in land or real estate;

-   Any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one
    year from the date of contract;

-   Any contract where you give a guarantee for payment of someone
    else’s debt or for something else that they are supposed to do or
    not do.

When you have a contract in writing and it has been signed, you and the
other party (or parties) will generally be held to the terms of the
bargain that you have reached. As mentioned, it’s easier to prove what
those terms are when the contract is in writing – and often impossible
to prove what they are if the contract is not recorded. “Writing”
includes emails and it can even include things such as SMS and WhatsApp
messages.

Usually, the written contract needs to be signed by at least you or the
other party too. Alternatively, one of you might show by some kind of
action demonstrating that the terms of the contract are accepted. For
example, when your bank sends you a new credit card it may say something
like “By using this credit card you agree to our terms and conditions”.
That brings the contract with your bank into existence without you
signing it. You can also agree to the terms of a contract by sending an
email, SMS, or other electronic communication that shows you accept its
terms.

Sometimes a Court implies additional terms into a contract, even if the
terms are not actually in the contract. This happens if the Court thinks
that a term is so necessary to the contract that you and the other
party/parties must have intended it to be included when you entered into
the contract.

Often, companies and other businesses will have standard contract terms
and you don’t have a chance to negotiate with them. Credit card terms
and conditions are an example of standard contract terms. Another
example is online terms and conditions if you want to download software
and must first click on “I accept” or similar words. The company that
delivers gas bottles to you or that services your aircon will almost
certainly present you with their standard contract terms. Your only
choice is to agree to the standard terms or to not go ahead with getting
the relevant goods or services.

Nevertheless, if you agree to such standard terms (including by simply
going ahead and accepting the goods or services), the standard terms
will generally be binding on you. It makes no difference that you don’t
like them. It makes no difference if you didn’t really have any choice.
It makes no difference that you didn’t bother to read them – or that you
tried to read them but couldn’t understand them.

So, what should you do? You should always read standard terms carefully
and understand them before signing the contract and/or going ahead and
getting the goods or services. That way you’ll know what agreement
you’re reaching with the company or other business. And if you really
don’t like their standard terms you can find out if you can get the
goods or services from someone else on better terms; otherwise, you
should think about whether you really do need to get them.

***When does a contract come to an end?***

A contract comes to an end when:

-   You and the other party have done everything that was supposed to
    have been done under the contract.

-   For example, a contract for you to buy a house is “fully performed”
    when you pay for the house (including where you pay with a loan from
    the bank) and the title to the house is transferred to you. A
    contract for a year of aircon servicing is fully performed when each
    servicing scheduled under it for the year has been done and you’ve
    paid for each such servicing.

-   You and/or the other party to the contract agree to stop
    performance.

-   For example, when you resign from your job or when an employer does
    a retrenchment exercise or if you sell your house halfway through a
    year of aircon servicing and you and the servicing company agree
    that they won’t do any more servicing and you don’t need to pay them
    any more.

-   It becomes impossible to continue performance because of something
    outside the control of both parties.

-   For example, as the result of a natural disaster like an earthquake
    or a typhoon.

-   You breach a significant term of the contract and the other party
    decides to terminate the contract or they breach a significant term
    and you decide to terminate the contract.

-   In such a situation, damages may be payable by the breaching party.
    In other circumstances, (such as the special case of the sale of
    land or a house), a court may order the breaching party to complete
    performance of the contract.

***What is the Unfair Contract Terms Act?***

If you are a consumer, the Unfair Contract Terms Act is intended to
protect you from companies and other businesses that might put unfair
terms into their contracts. For example, a term that tries to exclude or
limit the company’s or other business’s liability to you (known as
exception clauses) might be made wholly ineffective under the Act. Or it
might be ineffective unless the company or other business can show that
it is reasonable after considering some factors stated in the Act.

You may also refer to chapter 10 on Consumer Protection.

**TORTS**

You might suffer damage as the result of a tort – either because someone
did something that they should not do (such as create a neighbourhood
disturbance) or didn’t do something that they should have done (such as
make sure that they were driving safely). The person responsible may be
liable to pay money to you to compensate you for the damage you suffer
because of their action or inaction.

There is sometimes a close relationship between torts and the criminal
law. Sometimes the same act can be a criminal offence as well as giving
rise to liability for a tort. For example, the driver who causes damage
to you by not driving safely may also be charged in court for a criminal
act of reckless driving.

***How do I prove a tort?***

If you are the victim of a tort and want to recover damages, you must
show that the type of damage was caused by the tort and is legally
recognisable in Singapore. Examples of such damage include physical
injuries, damage to property, reputational damage (e.g. defamation),
economic damage (e.g. unlawful interference with contract) or emotional
damage.

In general, liability for tort may be found where:

-   Person A acts negligently in a situation where they owe Person B a
    duty of care. This is usually limited to situations in which a
    special relationship exists between them (e.g. doctor-patient).

-   Person A intentionally and deliberately causes damage to Person B,
    such as defamation, trespassing on land or false imprisonment. A
    conspiracy to injure may also give rise to tort liability, but it
    requires more than one person to commit the tort of conspiracy.

-   Person A breaches a statutory obligation and, in doing so, causes
    damage to Person B. The scope of liability in such situations is
    often limited.

**5 Defamation**

When you write or say something that causes someone “harm”, your words
can be considered defamatory by the court, especially when those words
have been read or heard by many people. Causing harm (“defamation”) can
be defined as causing the person to lose his credibility or reputation;
causing the person to be shunned or avoided; or simply exposing the
person to potential ridicule, contempt or hatred. Whether your words are
explicit or implied, or whether you merely repeated what someone else
has written, you can still be liable for defamation. Liability is not
based on your intention to defame someone; the law is more concerned
with the effect of your statements. What this means is that even if you
could prove that you had no intention to defame anyone, you still would
not be allowed off the hook because the court would deem that the harm
or damage has been done.

Defamation includes:

1.  “Libel” - the term generally used for defamatory statements made in
    writing or in print or in some other permanent form; and

2.  “Slander” - the term generally used for defamatory statements made
    orally (i.e. spoken words).

The laws governing defamation in Singapore are the Penal Code (Chapter
224) and the Defamation Act (Chapter 75). Defamation may be a criminal
offence as well as a civil wrong. The defences to criminal defamation
are different from the defences to a civil action for defamation; these
are discussed in the below sections.

**DEFENCES TO A CHARGE OF DEFAMATION **

Under Section 499 of the Penal Code, the following exceptions may not
constitute defamation:

1.  It is not defamation to impute anything that is true concerning any
    person, if it is for the public good that such imputation should be
    made or published.

2.  It is not defamation to express in good faith (i.e. honestly and
    sincerely) any opinion regarding the conduct of any person in
    carrying out his public functions, or regarding his character in
    relation to that conduct, and no further.

3.  It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion regarding
    the conduct of any person touching any public question, and
    regarding his character in relation to that conduct, and no further.

-   For example, it is not defamation if Ms. X expresses in good faith
    any opinion regarding Ms. Z’s conduct in petitioning the Government
    on a public question.

1.  It is not defamation to publish a substantially true report of the
    proceedings of a court of justice, or of Parliament, or of the
    result of any such proceedings.

2.  It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion regarding
    the merits of any case, which has been decided by a court of
    justice, or regarding the conduct of any person who is either a
    party, a witness or an agent, in any such case, or regarding the
    character of such person in relation to that conduct, and no
    further.

-   For example, it is not defamation if Ms. X, in good faith, says, “I
    think Ms. Z’s evidence on that trial is so contradictory that she
    must be stupid or dishonest”; as her opinion is in relation to Ms.
    Z’s character as it appears in Ms. Z’s conduct as a witness.
    However, if Ms. X says, “I do not believe what Ms. Z said at that
    trial, because I know her to be a liar”, the statement may be
    considered defamatory as Ms. X’s opinion of Ms. Z’s character is not
    based on Ms. Z’s conduct as a witness.

1.  It is not defamation to express in good faith any opinion regarding
    the merits of any performance which its author has submitted to the
    judgment of the public, or regarding the character of the author in
    relation to such performance, and no further.

-   For example, a person who publishes a book or makes a speech or
    performance in public submits the book, the speech and the
    performance to the judgment of the public, and any criticism of it
    is not considered defamation.

1.  It is not defamation if a person having authority over another,
    either conferred by law, or arising out of a lawful contract with
    that other, passes in good faith any censure on the conduct of that
    other in matters to which such lawful authority relates.

-   For example, it is not defamation if the head of a department
    censures in good faith those working under his/her orders, or if a
    banker censures in good faith the cashier of his/her bank for the
    cashier’s professional conduct.

1.  It is not defamation to proffer an accusation, in good faith,
    against any person to any other person who has lawful authority over
    that person with respect to the subject-matter of the accusation.

-   For example, it is not defamation if, Ms. X in good faith complains
    of the conduct of Ms. Z’s child to her.

1.  It is not defamation to make an imputation on the character of
    another, provided that the imputation is made in good faith for the
    protection of the interests of the person making it, or of any other
    person, or for the public good.

-   For example, if Ms. X, a shopkeeper, says to Ms. Z, who manages her
    business, “Sell nothing to Ms. Y unless she pays you ready money,
    for I have a low opinion of her honesty”, Ms. X’s statement is not
    defamatory if she made the statement in good faith and for the
    protection of her interests.

1.  It is not defamation to convey a caution, in good faith, to one
    person against another, provided that the caution is intended for
    the good of the person to whom it is conveyed, or of some person in
    whom that person is interested, or for the public good.

**ONLINE DEFAMATION **

It is possible to commit defamation in the online world by posting on
websites, blogs and social networking sites like Facebook. Even tweets
on Twitter and to an extent, SMSes and emails, may be subject to a
defamation suit where one may be liable to pay damages. There is a range
of defences available, like justification, fair comment and qualified
privilege, but one should generally be careful when making allegations
of misconduct. It is always good practice to verify the source or truth
of one’s information.

**CRIMINAL DEFAMATION **

There is also the offence of criminal defamation under section 499 of
the Penal Code. If you write or say something with the intention to
harm, or have reason to believe that your words will cause harm to the
reputation of the person, you have committed criminal defamation. The
exceptions to criminal defamation are set out above *(Defences to
Charges of Defamation)*. The penalty for criminal defamation is
imprisonment for a term that may extend to two years, or a fine, or
both.

**BREACH OF CONFIDENCE **

If you publish or upload photographs taken of another person in a
private setting without authorisation, you may expose yourself to a
lawsuit for breach of confidence, even though the nature of your acts of
publishing is not defamatory as defined above. If, as the photographer,
you know (or ought to know) that the person being photographed expects
that the photos will be kept private, the court may construe that there
is a relationship of confidence between the two parties. So, in
publishing such photos, you may be deemed to have committed a breach of
confidence. In the online world, where it is common for friends to be
uploading and geo-tagging photos, it is always good practice and a
courtesy to inform your friends, if they don’t already know.

**6 Harassment**

**PROTECTION FROM HARASSMENT ACT**

The Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”), which came into force in
November 2014, was introduced to strengthen harassment laws in
Singapore. POHA provides for both civil remedies and criminal sanctions
to better protect victims of harassment. POHA applies both to the
physical world and online world, and may also apply to offences
committed outside Singapore as long as certain conditions are satisfied.
For example, where an offender who is overseas stalks a victim who is in
Singapore, and the offender knew or ought to have known that the victim
would be in Singapore when doing so, he may be found guilty in Singapore
of the offence of stalking.

***What kinds of acts constitute harassment under POHA? ***

POHA protects people from acts (including words, behaviour, or
communications) that were carried out with intent to cause, or are
likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress. Examples of such acts
include:

-   Behaving in a threatening, abusive or insulting manner (for example,
    spray-painting insulting words on your door).

-   Loudly and graphically describing a person’s sexual inclinations in
    an insulting manner, knowing that they are within earshot and with
    the intention of causing him/her distress.

-   Using threatening, abusive or insulting words (including via
    electronic communication like emails, blogs and Facebook posts).

-   Behaving in a manner that causes a person to fear that violence will
    be inflicted to you (for example, threatening you that he/she will
    beat you up and telling you to watch out).

-   Threatening, abusing or insulting public servants or public service
    workers.

***Unlawful Stalking ***

POHA is also the first legislation that protects people from unlawful
stalking. Examples of unlawful stalking acts covered by POHA include:

-   Persistent communication (with telephone calls, SMSes, emails,
    letters) despite you telling him/her not to.

-   Sending unwanted materials (eg. flowers or revealing photographs) to
    you or leaving it where it will be found by you, such as at your
    office.

-   Loitering and watching you near your office or residence.

-   Following you around (for example, from your residence to work).

***Publishing False Statements***

When a false statement of fact has been published about any person, the
victim can also apply for a court order requiring the removal and
cessation of publication of that false statement (Non-Publication
Order). The court can also require the publication of a suitable
notification to alert readers that the statements are false.

***What can I do if I am a victim? ***

-   You may lodge a police report against the perpetrator.
    Alternatively, you may make a Magistrates’ complaint against the
    perpetrator. The court may order an investigation and the
    perpetrator may be penalised with a fine or imprisonment or a
    community order. To make a complaint, go to the Complaints Counter
    of the Crime Registry at Level 1 of the State Courts during office
    hours. Alternatively, you may wish to visit the State Court’s
    website at [www.statecourts.gov.sg](http://www.statecourts.gov.sg)
    for more information.

-   You may sue the perpetrator who harassed you. The court may order
    the perpetrator to pay to you a sum of money as compensation. You
    may consider engaging a lawyer to evaluate the merits of your case
    before commencing civil action against the perpetrator.

-   You may apply for a Protection Order or a Non-Publication Order
    (PO/NPO) against the perpetrator. A Protection Order requires the
    perpetrator to stop the acts of harassment/stalking. The Court can
    also issue an Expedited Protection Order where immediate protection
    against the perpetrator is required. A Non-Publication Order is an
    order to a harasser not to publish or to stop publishing the
    offending statement unless a notification on the falsehood is also
    published. To apply for a PO/NPO by yourself, go to the Harassment
    Cases Registry at Level 1 of the State Courts, Community Justice and
    Tribunals Division, during office hours. Please bring along your
    NRIC and evidence of the harassment/stalking. Alternatively, you may
    wish to engage a lawyer to apply for the PO/NPO on your behalf.

-   You may also seek other self-help remedies by visiting the Community
    Mediation Centre for a mediation option, or the Community Justice
    Centre for a consultation with a volunteer lawyer.

Courts website at:

**7 Personal Injury**

**COMMON TYPES OF PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS**

Personal injury may be suffered in a variety of situations. Common
situations where personal injury claims arise include but are not
restricted to road traffic accidents, industrial accidents, medical
negligence, assault cases, slip-and-fall cases, and defective product
liability cases.

**CAUSE OF ACTION**

The fact that you have suffered injury does not necessarily mean that
you will be able to recover compensation. You must first figure out if
you are able to recover compensation from the party responsible, i.e.
whether you have a cause of action against the party alleged to be
responsible.

A party is legally responsible for your loss or injury if the party:

1.  Owes a duty to you;

2.  Had failed in that duty; and

3.  By either an act or failure to do something (omission), has caused
    you to suffer harm and loss.

**ESTABLISHING LIABILITY**

Each case will turn on its facts, and therefore it is important that you consult a lawyer on the chance of success in establishing the legal liability of the party responsible. For example, in a medical negligence case, it is no sufficient that you show that the medical professional had failed to meet the standard generally applied by a responsible body of medical persons skilled in that field. In the recent case of Hii Chii Kok v Ooi Peng Jin London Lucien and another [\[2017\] 2 SLR 492](javascript:void()); [\[2017\] SGCA 38](javascript:void()), the Court of Appeal at [\[131\]](https://www.lawnet.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=openContentPage&contentDocID=/SLR/20747-SSP.xml&queryStr=(Hii%20Chii%20Kok%20v%20London%20Lucien%20Ooi)#p1_131) to [\[134\]](https://www.lawnet.sg/lawnet/group/lawnet/page-content?p_p_id=legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_count=1&_legalresearchpagecontent_WAR_lawnet3legalresearchportlet_action=openContentPage&contentDocID=/SLR/20747-SSP.xml&queryStr=(Hii%20Chii%20Kok%20v%20London%20Lucien%20Ooi)#p1_134) laid down the three step process: First, the patient would have to identify the exact nature of the information that he alleged was not given to him and establish why it would be regarded as relevant and material. Second, the court would determine whether the information was in the possession of the doctor at the relevant time. Third, the court would determine whether the doctor was justified in withholding the information. In essence, the court in approaching a medical negligence case had to guard against “hindsight bias” and “outcome bias”. A doctor’s conduct had to be assessed against the facts, information and insights available at the material time and not those which came to light afterwards.

In a slip-and-fall case, you need to show that the person responsible
had control over the premises and he/she knew or ought to have known of
the danger, and had failed to correct the danger or warn you of it.

You should also explore with your lawyer the possibility that the other
party could defeat your claim. In a road traffic accident case, the
other party may allege that you contributed to your injury if you failed
to take proper safety precautions. In an assault case, the party
responsible may claim that you had provoked him/her or that he/she had
acted in self-defence.

**DAMAGES**

If you can establish that your injury was caused by the wrongdoing of
the other party, you will be able to recover compensation for your
personal injury and for the resulting losses.

The large majority of claims for personal injury involve claims for
physical bodily injury. However, it is also worth noting that while
compensation is most often granted for physical suffering, personal
injury is not just confined to physical bodily injury. Personal injury
can include mental suffering if it constitutes a recognisable
psychiatric illness, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”).
Personal injury also encompasses diseases, where, for example, in
industrial accident claims the employee may recover compensation for
diseases contracted at the work place.

You should seek advice from your lawyer on the range of damages that you
can pursue in Court for your type of personal injury. Your lawyer will
be able to draw from past cases to provide an estimate of the amount,
and the amount will depend on the severity of your personal injury and
the lingering residual disabilities that you might be plagued with.

Apart from compensation for your personal injury, the Court may also
order the party responsible to bear the consequential losses from the
injury, such as loss of wages, medical expenses and transport expenses
to seek medical treatment. In appropriate cases where the ability to
work is adversely affected, the Court may award compensation for loss of
earning capacity/future earnings. If there is long-term medical care
required, the Court might also make an award for the cost of future
medical treatment. However, the Court generally only makes an award for
losses that are foreseeable (i.e. not overly far-fetched and vague).
Therefore, where the losses are not foreseeable and are considered too
remote, these claims will fail.

**LIMITATION PERIOD**

The law also prescribes a limited time period of three years for
personal injury claims to be lodged in Court. The three-year period is
calculated from the date of the incident that gave rise to your injury.
However, there are exceptions to this. One exception is when the injury
is initially hidden, and the symptoms of injury do not appear or
manifest until a later stage. In such cases, the limitation period of
three years starts from the earliest time when you knew or ought to have
known that you have such an injury.

The limitation period is extended for claimants who are under disability
and/or minors. If the claimant is suffering from mental incapacity (e.g.
a coma), the three-year period begins from the time that the claimant is
no longer suffering from mental incapacity. For a person who is in a
coma, the three-year period begins from the time the claimant regains
consciousness or from the date of death in the event the claimant
succumbs to death without recovering from the coma. In the case of a
minor, the limitation period expires three years after the claimant
turns 21 years old.

In either class of victims, their claims may be brought to Court through
appointed litigation representatives. In the case of a minor, the claims
may be brought by a legal guardian, usually either a parent or the
next-of-kin. In the case of a mentally incapacitated person, the
next-of-kin will have to apply to the Family Justice Courts pursuant to
the Mental Capacity Act for a Court order to allow the claim for
compensation to be brought by the next-of-kin on the victim’s behalf.

**ALTERNATIVE SETTLEMENT**

It bears noting that instead of advancing a claim in Court – where the
process may be long-drawn, costly and draining – you may wish to
consider effecting a settlement with the other party. You should engage
a lawyer to determine whether you have a cause of action, to quantify
the damages and to ascertain whether it is possible to reach a
settlement with the other party.

**8 Traffic Accidents **

The Motor Claims Framework (“MCF”), introduced by the General Insurance
Association of Singapore (“GIA”) in June 2008, is intended to be a
policy condition that motor insurers will enforce. The MCF sets out
procedures for motorists to follow when their vehicles meet with an
accident.

Under the MCF all accidents, regardless of how minor and even if the
damage is not visible, must be reported to your insurer (GIA report)
within 24 hours or by the next working day. This is regardless of any
intention to make a claim and any private settlement.

**WHAT TO DO AT THE ACCIDENT SITE**

1.  If it is a serious accident and someone is injured or has died, call
    the police.

2.  Take down and exchange the: (a) registration numbers and name of
    insurance companies of all vehicles involved in the accident;
    and (b) names, NRIC/FIN Numbers, addresses and telephone numbers of
    the drivers, passengers, injured pedestrians and witnesses. If
    possible take photographs of the: (a) scene of the accident,
    including the vehicles involved and the surrounding areas; and (b)
    damage to your own vehicle and all other vehicles, making sure to
    capture the licence plate numbers.

3.  Call your insurer’s hotline for a tow truck in the event you need
    one to move your vehicle after an accident. You should not engage
    any unauthorised tow truck operators or repair workshops.

This information will come in handy in situations where you have been
charged under the Road Traffic Act and/or Penal Code of Singapore.

**WHAT TO DO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT**

1.  <span class="underline">Lodge a GIA report and a police report as
    soon as possible</span>. If you are hospitalised as a result of the
    accident, make your report as soon as you are discharged from
    hospital. The report must be made in English. The police report is
    important because it is the official record of the accident. Your
    insurance company, the police and lawyers will refer to it if you
    make any claim for compensation.

1.  In the event that you failed to notify your insurer, your insurer
    will have the right to reject your claim, or seek a claim from you
    for any sums paid by them for a third party claim made against you
    or your driver. This may result in a loss of your No Claim Discount
    upon renewal of your insurance policy.

2.  <span class="underline">Arrange for your damaged vehicle to be
    removed</span> to the approved reporting centre for a survey to be
    conducted and for repairs, within 24 hours of the accident or by the
    next working day. If you wish to claim against the insurer of the
    other vehicle, you should give the other vehicle’s insurer an
    opportunity to inspect your vehicle within a reasonable time (e.g.
    48 hours).

3.  <span class="underline">If you have been injured</span>, see a
    doctor immediately and get a medical report.

**HOW DO I MAKE A CLAIM?**

1.  <span class="underline">Claim against your own insurance
    company</span>: Please take note of any “excess” clause in your
    insurance policy.

1.  Your claim must exceed the excess amount, and your insurance company
    will only pay the difference between your claim and the excess
    amount. For example, if the excess amount is $700 and your claim is
    $500 the insurers will not pay out at all. However, if the excess
    amount if $700 and your claim is $1,000, you will pay $700 and your
    insurers will only pay $300.

2.  <span class="underline">Claim against another person</span>: It is
    advisable to see a lawyer. Please remember that lawyers can
    represent you only if you authorise them to do so, usually by
    signing a warrant to act. Please be informed that vehicle workshops
    are not authorised to make claims on your behalf.

3.  <span class="underline">Claiming in hit-and-run cases</span>: If you
    suffer personal injuries as a result of an accident and do not know
    the particulars of the other party that caused the accident, you may
    file a claim with the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (“MIB”).

4.  <span class="underline">Police Summons</span>: If you receive a
    Police Summons informing you that you are facing a charge for an
    offence related to the accident, you should inform your insurer and
    seek advice from a lawyer immediately before taking any course of
    action. Do note that if you plead guilty, accept a warning or pay
    the composition fine, it can be later used against you at the civil
    proceedings when the victim claims for damages for personal injury.

**WHAT TO DO IF A CLAIM IS MADE AGAINST ME?**

1.  If you receive a Letter of Demand from a third party driver/owner or
    his/her lawyers, you should inform your insurer **<span
    class="underline">immediately</span>**. The Letter of Demand will
    contain a paragraph telling you to forward the claim together with
    the supporting documents to your insurer.

2.  If a Writ of Summons is served on you personally, you should also
    immediately inform your insurer so that they can handle the matter
    for you themselves or appoint lawyers on your behalf to do so. It is
    important to remember that within eight days of the date of service
    of the Writ of Summons on you, a Memorandum of Appearance (a Court
    document) must be filed in Court. Failing to do so can result in
    either a Final Judgment or Interlocutory Judgment entered against
    you.

3.  It is important to be mindful of these matters to avoid incurring or
    escalating costs for yourself.

4.  If your insurer denies liability under the Policy for whatever
    reason, you may want to engage your own lawyer to handle your case.
    You will bear the legal costs in such a case.

**TIME LIMITATIONS FOR CLAIMS**

-   Non-injury motor claims: The law allows you six years to make a
    claim for property damage, that is, damage to the vehicle.

-   Personal injury cases: The time limitation for personal injury cases
    is much shorter. An injured person has only three years from the
    date of the accident to make his claim. Thereafter the claim will be
    time-barred, unless the victim is a minor, or has a mental
    disability i.e. in a comatose state.

**KEEPING RECORDS**

For purposes of pursuing any claim and/or to defend any potential
claims, you should keep a proper record of the following:

-   Particulars in the paragraph above on “What to do at the accident
    site”;

-   Names and particulars of witnesses;

-   Copies of police reports and your GIA reports;

-   Medical and specialist reports;

-   A list of expenses incurred, e.g. transport, medical fees and rental
    of car; and

-   Documents supporting your claim such as photographs, medical
    certificates, repair bills, receipts and so forth.

**WHAT CAN A PERSON CLAIM?**

<span class="underline">General damages:</span> This compensates you for
pain and suffering as a result of injuries caused to your person
(“personal injuries”). There are guidelines issued by the Court
depending on the kind and severity of the personal injuries.

<span class="underline">Special damages:</span> This compensates you for
expenses incurred, e.g. costs of medical fees, transport, repairs to
vehicle, hiring another vehicle while your vehicle is being repaired,
loss of salary and CPF savings contributions before the trial. These
must be specifically proved and therefore you must keep the original
receipts and other supporting documents for these expenses and/or
losses.

<span class="underline">Bereavement:</span> If it is a fatal accident,
the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) entitles those listed under Section 21(2) to
claim for bereavement. This includes children, parents of the deceased
and so forth. It is fixed at $15,000, and this is to be divided among
the number of claimants notwithstanding how many there are.

**FORUMS TO COMMENCE LEGAL ACTIONS**

Any claim for non-injury motor damages (i.e. only damage to the vehicle)
**below $100,000** will proceed to the Financial Industry Disputes
Resolution Centre (“FIDReC”). There are no lawyers involved in this
scheme. It is an avenue to resolve disputes directly between consumers
and the insurance companies.

For claims **less than $250,000**, you can commence your action at the
State Courts.

Any amount **above $250,000** is within the jurisdiction of the High
Court.

At the State Courts, the matter will be sent for a Neutral Evaluation.
This is presided over by a Judge Evaluator who will consider the various
accident reports and any other relevant evidence to determine the
parties’ likelihood of success at trial (i.e. the liability, or legal
responsibility, of the parties). Sometimes, the Court will direct
parties to appear in person. The Judge Evaluator will then give an
indication of the liability of the parties. The parties can either
accept or reject the Court’s indication.

If you do not accept the indication of the Court, you must be prepared
to proceed to trial. If this is against the advice of your insurers, you
will have to bear the costs yourself if you lose the case. If both
parties accept the indication, they can proceed to settle or negotiate
the amount of compensation. Parties may do so either at a mediation
session, where an indication of the compensation amount will be given by
the presiding Mediation Judge, or proceed for an Assessment of Damages
hearing (“AD”). The AD is similar to a trial, but the Court will only
decide on the amount of compensation (since liability has already been
dealt with).

For matters commenced in the High Court, there is no Court mediation
process as set out above. However, it is common for parties to negotiate
an out-of-court settlement with the assistance of their respective
lawyers.

You should bear in mind that costs continue to escalate the further one
proceeds in the legal process. Therefore, you must consider the
practicalities and the cost consequences of any case.

**DETERMINATION AT THE TRIAL/**

**ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES HEARING**

For liability, the Court can decide that one party is fully responsible
for the accident, thereby being “100% liable”. The Court can also decide
that the person making the claim (“Plaintiff”) is partially responsible
for the accident, i.e. contributory negligence.

The Court will assess the degree of responsibility in percentage terms
and divide the claim accordingly between the parties. For example, if
the Plaintiff is found to be 20% responsible for a $10,000 claim, then
he will only be awarded the sum of $8,000 as damages.

**9 Tenancy Obligations**

**WHAT IS A LEASE?**

A lease is a legally binding relationship between two parties involving
equipment, land or property. It is separate and different from a licence
agreement. There are two types of leases: a lease of equipment and a
lease of land, such as a lease of a landed property, or a lease of a
unit in a condo or a lease of a HDB flat. A business can also get a
lease of an office, factory or warehouse. This chapter concerns a lease
of land or other property.

The people involved in a lease are known as the parties to a lease. They
are:

-   The “Lessor”, which is the party granting the lease and who is
    sometimes called the “Landlord” – the party allowing someone else
    (the “Lessee”) to have the right to occupy their land or other
    property, and

-   The “Lessee”, who is sometimes called the “Tenant” – the party
    occupying the land or other property.

Sometimes, the Lessee gives a sub-lease to someone else to occupy the
land or property originally leased to that Lessee. The Lessee must be
allowed to do this by the Landlord. In this case:

-   The Lessor (Landlord) is usually called the “Head Lessor”,

-   The Lessee (original Tenant) is called by the “Lessee” and the
    “Sub-Lessor”, and

-   The Lessee leasing from the “Sub-Lessor” (original Tenant) is called
    the “Sub-Lessee”

To make this chapter more straightforward, we will restrict ourselves to
the simple Lessor-Lessee/Landlord-Tenant relationship where the Lessor
is the owner of the land or property and there is only one Lessee.
However, it is important to note that if a lease expressly prohibits the
Lessee from giving a sub-lease to someone else but the Lessee does it
anyway, this is a breach of the lease terms and the Lessor (Landlord)
will be able to terminate the lease.

A lease gives the Lessee a legal interest in the land or property. This
means that the Lessee has rights against third parties (such as the
right to keep them out of the premises). The Lessor gives the Lessee
possession of the premises for a certain period of time in exchange for
making certain rent and other payments.

The Lessor and Lessee usually enter into a written Lease Agreement,
which is often called a Tenancy Agreement, but you can also have oral
lease agreements. Both forms of lease agreements are legally binding,
but a written agreement helps to avoid disputes over the terms of the
lease. For further information on contracts, see Chapter 4.

***Lease vs. Licence***

A lease gives the Lessee a legal interest in the land or property. A
licence does not. A licence only gives a right to enter on to the land
or property, usually for a particular purpose and for a relatively short
period of time. A common example is what we see in a shopping centre in
Singapore. The owners of shops in the shopping centre have a lease;
businesses and individuals who are allowed to set up displays and even
temporary sales counters in the space outside the shops have a simple
licence that allows them to be there for a short period of time.

**TENANCY OR LEASE AGREEMENTS**

***Terms & Conditions***

The agreement between the Lessor (also known as the Landlord) and the
Lessee (also known as the Tenant) sets out the terms and conditions of
the lease. It should include certain basic terms.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em><strong>Demised Property </strong></em></td>
<td><p>“Demised Property” is simply a technical term for the land or property that is being leased.</p>
<p>What is the demised land or property?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This should be identified clearly, e.g. “The Landlord hereby lets and the Tenant hereby takes the property known as No. 786, Fidelio Road, #01-03, Singapore 048630.”</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em><strong>Duration</strong></em></td>
<td><p>How long is the lease for?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The commencement and expiry date of the lease should be made clear. E.g. “The Landlord will lease the demised property to the Tenant for a term of two years, commencing from 17 May 2013 and expiring on 16 May 2015.”</p></li>
<li><p>The parties are free to state the duration in terms of years or months or weeks.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em><strong>Rent </strong></em></td>
<td><p>How much rent is payable and when is it payable?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g. “The rent of Three Thousand Two Hundred Dollars ($3,200.00) is payable by the Tenant to the Landlord in advance without demand and without deductions on the 1st day of each calendar month. The first of such payment is payable on the 1st day of June 2013.”</p></li>
<li><p>Often there is a minimum amount of rent that must be paid – e.g., rent for one year, even if the lease is terminated before that time.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><em><strong>Rental Deposit</strong></em></td>
<td><p>This is a common term, as the Landlord will want security against any breaches that the Tenant may commit, e.g. breach for non-payment of rental, damage to the demised property, etc.</p>
<p>The lease should also provide for the return of the deposit at the end of the lease, including when this is returned and the amount to be returned, and specifying whether or not the Landlord is entitled to make any deductions from it and under what circumstances.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><em><strong>Legal Costs </strong></em></td>
<td>Most written lease agreements say that the Landlord can claim all legal costs and expenses incurred by the Landlord from the Tenant if the Landlord has to take legal action against the tenant for any breach of the lease agreement, whether for non-payment of rent or breaches of other covenants in the lease agreement.</td>
</tr>

**LANDLORD’S AND TENANT’S OBLIGATIONS**

Apart from the above basic terms, the following terms are also normally
found in a lease agreement. These terms set out the parties’ obligations
and common consequences of the Landlord or Tenant’s failure to abide by
their obligations.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Tenant’s obligation to pay rent on time </strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Late payment interest, i.e. if payment is tendered late, a Tenant must pay interest on the rental sum at a rate stipulated in the tenancy agreement (e.g. 1% per day).</p></li>
<li><p>If the Tenant does not pay the rent by a certain date after it is due, the Landlord is given the right to re-enter the demised property and take over possession. This will usually end the tenancy.</p></li>
<li><p>To re-enter the premises, the Landlord should expressly stipulate a right of re-entry, and serve a notice (under section 18 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act), specifying the breach complained of, the compensation sought, and the remedy to be undertaken by the Tenant.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Tenant’s obligation to keep the property in a fairly good state </strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>The Tenant’s duty is not limited to payment of rent. The Tenant is obliged to keep the property in a good state.</p></li>
<li><p>Lease agreements would normally also state which party (either the Landlord or the Tenant) is obliged to maintain different parts of the demised property (such as the maintenance of the insurance or the structure of the demised premises) or different items on the demised property (such as air-conditioning or other internal fittings).</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Obligations in respect of the determination and surrender of the lease </strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>It is common to find clauses in a lease agreement providing that the demised property has to return to the Landlord in “vacant possession”. This means that the Tenant must return the demised property to the Landlord in the same state the property was leased to the Tenant, with fair wear and tear excepted. Thus, if the Tenant has fixtures installed after moving in, these items must be removed before possession of the property is returned to the Landlord at the end of the lease. All items belonging to the Tenant must be removed by the stipulated date of surrender.</p></li>
<li><p>In cases where the Tenant fails to return vacant possession to the Landlord, the latter may take legal action against the Tenant for damages, e.g.:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="a">
<li><blockquote>
<p>For items of the Tenant not cleared from the demised premises, the Landlord may make claims against the Tenant for continued occupation of the demised premises.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>The Landlord may have the right to sell off the Tenant’s goods that are not cleared off from the demised premises at the end of the tenancy.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tenant will be made liable for the costs incurred by the Landlord in such cases.</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Tenant’s obligation upon Holding Over </strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Any Tenant found to be staying on at the demised premises beyond the duration of the tenancy is liable to the Landlord for payment of double the monthly rent for <span class="underline">“holding over”</span>. This applies if no express or implied agreement exists between the parties to extend the lease or there is no special permission granted by the Landlord for the Tenant to stay on.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Landlord’s obligation to allow Quiet Enjoyment</strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>In return for the Tenant observing its obligations under the tenancy agreement, the Landlord is legally obliged to allow the Tenant quiet enjoyment of the lease of the demise property. This means that the Landlord must allow his tenant to occupy the premises without any intrusions and disturbances. For example, the Landlord should not visit the property whenever he/she likes without previously asking the Tenant, and except for emergencies, the Landlord should not ask to visit late at night or on holidays.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Landlord’s obligation to mitigate (reduce) their own loss </strong></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>For any loss that a Tenant may cause flowing out of the tenancy agreement, the Landlord has a duty to reduce this loss. For example, the Landlord should make efforts to find another tenant if he/she evicts the Tenant for non-payment of rent.</p></li>
</ul></td>

**10 Consumer Protection**

**Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act**

In Singapore there is a law called the Consumer Protection (Fair
Trading) Act (“CPFTA”). If you are a “consumer”, the purpose of the law
is to give you some protection when you buy goods and services from a
company or other business in Singapore.

You can only be a consumer if you are an individual – in other words,
you can’t be a consumer if you buy goods or services for a company or
other business that you work for or run yourself, i.e. a business
purchasing goods or services.

If you are a consumer the CPFTA can protect you if you have a legal
obligation to pay a company or other business – called a “supplier” in
the CPFTA – for goods or services that you have bought from them.

***When the CPFTA does not protect you***

Even if you are a consumer, the CPFTA does not protect you if what you
bought is land, such as a landed property. But it does protect you if
you go into a lease or tenancy agreement or if you buy a place in a
time-share property. The CPFTA doesn’t protect you for any services
provided under an employment contract.

***When the CPFTA protects you***

The CPFTA protects you when the supplier of goods or services to you
does something that is an “unfair practice”.

Here are some examples:

-   If they said that the goods you bought are new or that they haven’t
    been used, but this turns out not to be true.

-   If you bought goods and they said that there was a repair place for
    them in Singapore if there were any problems, but this turns out not
    to be true.

-   If there was small writing print in the contract with you and they
    used this to hide something important from you or they used it to
    mislead you.

There are some limits. The CPFTA only protects you if the amount you
would claim from the supplier of goods or services to you is $30,000 or
less. Also, the CPFTA only protects you if you make the claim within two
years of when you found out that the supplier had done an unfair
practice to you.

***What to do if there has been an unfair practice***

The first thing you need to do if an unfair practice has been done to
you is to try to settle it with the supplier of the goods or services.
You might have a right to cancel the contract, and this is explained
later in this chapter.

To try to settle with the supplier you should contact them and see if
you can work out something with them that solves your problem. For
example, say you bought an item that they said was new and unused but
this turns out not to be true. You might be able to agree with the
supplier that they will take it back and swap it for a new one. Or they
might offer you a discount on the price if you are happy to keep the
item and pay the lower price.

If talking to the supplier doesn’t solve your problem, a mediation
service might be able to help you. Mediation is an intervention by an
independent, neutral third party to help the parties settle their
dispute. The best-known example of a mediation service is probably the
Consumers Association of Singapore (“CASE”). There are also
industry-specific mediation services, such as the Financial Industry
Disputes Resolution Centre Ltd (“FIDReC”). CASE is usually a good place
to start because they can tell you if there is an industry-specific
mediation service that might be able to help you. Another reason why
CASE is a good place to start is that they keep information about bad
suppliers, and if they get a lot of complaints about the same supplier
CASE intervenes to improve their business practices.

If neither of these solutions works, you could consider filing a claim
with the Small Claims Tribunal (“SCT”). You might need to get a lawyer
to help you with this or you might find that the information online
about filing claims with the SCT tells you everything you need to know.
Alternatively, depending on your damages, you could consider filing a
claim with a Court, but to file a claim with a Court you will almost
certainly need a lawyer to help you.

***Direct sales contracts and time-share contracts***

You might have a right to cancel your contract with the supplier, but
this right is available only if the contract between you and the
supplier is a “direct sales” contract or a “time-share” contract. Here’s
how to work out if a contract is a direct sales contract or a time-share
contract.

There are two ways for a contract to be a direct sales contract.

1.  If you signed the contract with a supplier that came to your door to
    sell you something without you asking them to come and see you –
    these are usually called “door-to-door” sales. This is because the
    salesperson just comes along and knocks on every door in your block
    to try to sell their goods or services to whoever opens the door to
    a flat. Sometimes these sales-people start by giving out free gifts
    at a local shopping mall in order to try to get consent to visit you
    to sell you something – this is a way of evading the law about
    direct sales contracts, so be suspicious when you’re out shopping
    and someone offers you something that’s too good to be true, such as
    a gift. Examples of the types of items sold include vacuum cleaners,
    frying pans and mattress cleaning systems.

2.  If you signed the contract when you asked the salesperson to come
    and see you but then they switched to selling you something that you
    hadn’t been asking about and that you wouldn’t have expected to be
    part of their business. For example, if you invited someone to come
    and talk to you about getting grilles for your windows but when they
    came they got you to sign a contract for a new kitchen.

You can spot a time-share contract if you get invited to a seminar or
other event to find out about an investment opportunity or to get a good
deal for holiday discounts. Sometimes, you’re simply told that there
will be free prizes available if you attend. Under the CPFTA, a
time-share contract is where a supplier sells you a right to use a
resort or other living accommodation in Singapore or elsewhere for at
least three years in exchange for paying, typically, about $10,000 to
$30,000. Quite often, this is what an organizer is going to sell to you
if you attend such an event.

***Cancelling a direct sales contract or a time share contract***

If you are a consumer and you sign a direct sales contract or a time
share contract you have a five working days “cooling off” period. This
means that for five working days after you sign the contract you can
change your mind about going ahead with it and you can cancel the
contract.

This cooling off period is intended to give you protection against
high-pressure sales tactics, including where the only way to get rid of
the salesperson is to sign the contract that they want you to sign. Even
where there isn’t high-pressure, whenever you sign a direct sales
contract or a time share contract, you should review your purchasing
decision carefully after you’ve signed the contract – such as the next
day when you can think about it more clearly – and decide whether or not
you want to go ahead or to cancel the contract.

If you decide to cancel you must notify the supplier in <span
class="underline">writing</span>.

**LEMON LAW: NON-CONFORMING GOODS**

In March 2012 the CPFTA was changed to give consumers better protection
when they purchase goods that turn out to be defective. Defective goods
are called “lemons” in manufacturing industries; the press began to
refer to these added protections as the “Lemon Law” and the name stuck.

If you are a consumer and you acquire goods that are defective and
covered by the Lemon Law, you can require the supplier to repair,
replace, or reduce the price of the goods. Alternatively, you can return
the defective goods back and require the supplier to give you a refund.

If it is disproportionately costly or impossible to repair or replace
the goods, you can either keep them at a reduced price or return them
and get a refund.

***The timing of a Complaint***

If you discover the defect within six months of the goods being
delivered to you, the supplier has to show that the defect did not exist
at the time of delivery. Otherwise, you have the rights described above.

If you discover the defect later than six months after the goods were
delivered to you, you only have the rights described above if you can
prove that the defect existed when the goods were delivered to you.

You can’t exercise the rights described above if you:

-   Caused the defect or damage (including any defect or damage by
    improper care or storage);

> Misused the goods and that misuse caused the defect;

-   Repaired the good without authorisation;

-   Knew about the defect before buying the goods;

-   Changed your mind and do not want the goods; or

-   Found that the goods could not perform a special function that was
    not part of the contract.

If you make a fraudulent claim, you can be sued and you might face
criminal charges.

***Are online transactions covered?***

Yes, online purchases of physical goods – goods that can be touched,
such as clothes or household goods – are covered by the Lemon Law. But
online purchases of services or virtual goods – goods that can’t be
touched, such as objects purchased in an online game – are **not**
covered by the Lemon Law.

The Lemon Law applies to physical goods sold whether or not the supplier
is located in Singapore. However, it may be difficult or impossible to
enforce your rights under the Lemon Law against a supplier that isn’t in
Singapore because you might need the help of a Court in the supplier’s
country to do so.

**11 Construction and Renovation Claims**

Our homes and properties are big-ticket items. Sprucing them up to a
desired condition for living or work can be a substantial investment,
both in terms of time and money. Construction and renovation costs are
not insignificant and with increased levies for foreign workers and
rising costs of materials, such costs are likely to rise further. Late
completion can mean losses or additional expenses, e.g. loss of profit
because business cannot commence or rent for temporary accommodation.

Hence, it is important to ensure fair and adequate protection for you
and the employer. Here are some areas to look out for before, during and
after the construction process:

1.  Pick a reputable contractor:

    1.  The Consumer Association of Singapore (“CASE”) accredits
        > renovation contractors under their CaseTrust scheme and they
        > can be found at the CASE website, *http://www.case.org.sg*

    2.  Another organisation, the Renovation and Decoration Advisory
        > Centre (“RADAC”) also accredits renovation contractors.

    3.  Lastly, ask your friends for recommendations. If your friends
        > have had a pleasant experience with their contractor, they
        > will probably recommend that contractor to you.

2.  For Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flats, only registered
    contractors can renovate HDB flats and they can be found at HDB’s
    website:
    *https://www20.hdb.gov.sg/bn25/isos118p.nsf/List+by+Company?OpenView&Count=15&Start=1&RestrictToCategory=A\#*

3.  Shop around. Ask for quotations and compare them. Always compare
    like with like so list down what you want done and provide the same
    list to a few contractors for them to quote. Generally, there are
    various aspects of construction work:

    1.  Structural works – floors and columns

    2.  Walls and internal ceilings

    3.  Roofing

    4.  Floor finishes – tiles, marble and/or timber strips

    5.  Painting

    6.  Plumbing – toilet bowls, taps and baths

    7.  Lights and switches

    8.  Carpentry – cabinets and cupboards

    9.  Doors and door handles

    10. Furniture

4.  Ensure that you negotiate your contract. Some key points to look out
    for:

    1.  The contract should spell out clearly and in as much detail as
        > possible the works to be done, and provide that such works
        > should comply with industry standards. The Building and
        > Construction Authority (“BCA”) publishes guides on good
        > industry practice.

    2.  Ensure that the renovation or construction period is clear so
        > that where there is delay due to the fault of the contractor,
        > he/she needs to pay you liquidated damages at $X for each day
        > of delay. A good contractor can let you have the construction
        > schedule for the period of construction where it states the
        > nature of the works to be undertaken from commencement to
        > completion.

    3.  The contract should also provide for the situation where delay
        > is not the fault of the contractor, e.g. bad weather or if
        > inspections/approvals by the authorities hold up execution of
        > the works. The contractor should apply for an extension of
        > time to your consultant (who may be an architect or an
        > engineer) or to you, and if approved, this will push back the
        > completion date by the number of days so extended. Liquidated
        > damages can then run from the revised completion date if there
        > is delay even after this revised completion date.

    4.  Negotiate a retention sum of X% to be released after the defects
        > liability period, which is usually 12 months from completion.

    5.  Negotiate a performance bond. In the event of defects or
        non-compliance with specifications that the contractor refuses
        to attend to, you can call on the performance bond to pay for
        your costs of such rectification. However, ensure that you have
        quotations from other contractors to justify the amount that you
        are calling on. Usually, you will bear the costs of the
        performance bond since it is intended to protect your interest.

    6.  Specify that the contractor should attend to any defects,
        outstanding work or non-compliances with specifications within
        seven days of such notification.

    7.  It is inevitable that there will be variations to the original
        contract specifications. Ensure that all variations orders are
        in writing and they set out precisely the works to be done and
        the costs. The contractor should quote their costs in writing
        before you agree to them undertaking any variation works.

    8.  Do not make a lump sum payment for the entire contract value
        before commencement of work. Payment should be progressive so
        after the initial deposit, subsequent payments should be for
        work completed up to that stage. The contractor should
        substantiate what work has been done and you should pay only for
        such work done.

    9.  CASE has provided a model renovation contract which can be found
        at CASE’s website: *http://www.case.org.sg*

5.  Ensure that a precondition survey is undertaken before commencement
    of work. This will document the state of your home or workplace
    before renovations start.

6.  If there are defects, outstanding work or non-compliances with
    specifications, you should take photographs and communicate in
    writing such issues to the contractor. Compile a full list of such
    defects, outstanding work or non-compliances with specifications.

7.  The contractor should produce as-built drawings for the completed
    project and this should be stated in the contract.

8.  Complaints can be made to the HDB if a contractor does a sloppy job
    or the completed works have defects that the contractor refuses to
    attend to. Other avenues include complaints to CASE who can try to
    persuade the contractor to attend to these defects if the contractor
    persistently refuses to.

9.  In the event that there is no amicable resolution, you can bring a
    claim in the Courts or to the Small Claims Tribunal if the value of
    the claim is within its prescribed limits and within one year (see
    Part I). If the contract provides that all disputes are to be
    resolved by way of arbitration, you will need to commence
    arbitration proceedings (see Part VIII).

10. More information for homeowners and on resolving disputes can also
    be found at BCA’s website: *http://www.bca.gov.sg*

It is inevitable for defects or non-compliances to occur in a
construction or renovation project. The key is to ensure that the
contractor is obliged to rectify them, and within a fixed number of days
so that you have certainty on your rights. All of this should be
contained in the contract because your claim will be based on the
contract.

Once construction is completed for a major project, you would usually
need to apply for a temporary occupation permit (“TOP”) before you can
move in. After defects have been cleared and all checks by the
authorities completed, you should then apply for the certificate of
statutory completion (“CSC”). Your consultant usually applies for TOP
and CSC on your behalf.

Further, ensure that the contractor obtains adequate contractors’ all
risk insurance to cover third party claims and work injury compensation
claims.

**12 Bankruptcy/Debt Repayment Schemes**

**WHAT IS BANKRUPTCY?**

Bankruptcy is a legal process by which you are declared by the Court to
be “insolvent”, i.e. bankrupt. An insolvent person is someone who has no
financial means to satisfy any debts as and when they become due. After
you are declared bankrupt, the Official Assignee from the Insolvency &
Public Trustee’s Office (“IPTO”) will step in and manage your financial
affairs.

**BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS**

A bankruptcy application can be made by either your creditor or
yourself. All bankruptcy applications must be filed with the High Court.

The following criteria must be met:

1.  You must have some connection to Singapore (either by domicile,
    residence, place of business, or ownership of property in
    Singapore);

2.  The amount of debt is at least $15,000;

3.  The debt is for a liquidated sum (amount that can be
    determined/fixed) and is due immediately;

4.  The debtor is unable to pay the debt; and

5.  If the debt is incurred outside Singapore it is enforceable in
    Singapore by way of a judgment or award.

You are presumed to be unable to pay your debt if:

1.  You have been served with a Statutory Demand for the debt and you
    are unable to settle the debt within 21 days;

2.  Execution on a judgment debt has been levied (e.g. seizure and sale
    of immovable assets) and the debt remains wholly or partially
    unsatisfied;

3.  You leave and remain outside Singapore with the intention of
    avoiding and delaying the creditor’s recovery of the debt; or

4.  The Official Assignee from the IPTO issues one of the following:

1.  Certificate of Inapplicability of the Debt Repayment Scheme (“DRS”);

2.  Certificate of Failure of the DRS; or

3.  Revocation of the Certificate of Completion of DRS.

**CONSEQUENCES OF BEING DECLARED**

**“BANKRUPT” BY THE COURT**

Bankruptcy does not come with a label distinguishing you from any other
person on the street. However, once you are declared to be bankrupt,
your activities will be greatly affected. One of the first things you
must do is to make full disclosure of your assets and liabilities to the
Official Assignee. The Official Assignee can sell and distribute assets
(which are not protected under the law) to repay or reduce your debts as
he/she sees fit. You may be required to set aside part of your salary
towards debt repayment.

Other consequences of going bankrupt include:

1.  You must report any and every change in financial status, e.g.
    salary raise, to the Official Assignee.

2.  You cannot leave Singapore without the prior permission of the
    Official Assignee.

3.  If you are an existing director, secretary of a company, you must
    resign from such or any other management position immediately.

4.  You cannot be appointed as a trustee or as a personal representative
    of an estate without the approval of the Court.

**WHAT IS THE DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEME?**

The Debt Repayment Scheme was introduced to help debtors avoid
bankruptcy. It also helps creditors recover the debts owed to them. It
is essentially an installment payment scheme administered by the
Official Assignee to help you repay the debt. The maximum period of
repayment is five years.

**ELIGIBILITY FOR DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEME**

You can only be placed under the Debt Repayment Scheme if the following
criteria are met:

1.  The debt cannot exceed $100,000;

2.  You are gainfully employed and earned a stable monthly income;

3.  You have not been made a bankrupt in the last five years;

4.  You have not been subject to a Court-based debt arrangement (e.g.
    Debt Repayment Scheme) in the last five years; and

5.  You are not a sole-proprietor of a business, partner of a
    partnership or a limited liability partnership.

**HOW DOES IT WORK?**

The Debt Repayment Scheme comes into play when a bankruptcy application
is filed in Court. You can then ask the Court to place you under the
Debt Repayment Scheme. The Court can postpone the bankruptcy proceedings
for the Official Assignee to conduct an assessment on whether you are
suitable to be placed under the Debt Repayment Scheme.

If the Official Assignee assesses you to be eligible and suitable to be
placed under the Debt Repayment Scheme, the bankruptcy proceedings will
be put on hold and no further Court proceedings filed against you.
Meanwhile, the Official Assignee will hold a meeting with your creditors
and thereafter, decide on the debt repayment plan. The debtor commits to
the Debt Repayment Scheme and repays his/her debt over a fixed period of
time (not more than five years). When the debtor meets his/her financial
obligations under the scheme, he/she will be released from his/her debts
and have a fresh start thereafter. The Official Assignee will monitor
all your payments. If you default on your payments, the Official
Assignee will issue a Certificate of Failure of the DRS and your
creditor can then resume with bankruptcy proceedings against you.

**PART III FAMILY PROCEEDINGS**

**13 Grounds for Divorce**

You probably already know that life’s most difficult decisions involve
family – your spouse, your children, your parents or your own future
plans. Going through a divorce is not pleasant. It is very personal and
often highly emotional. It may be traumatic for you and your children.

Getting a divorce in Singapore depends on whether you get it under civil
law or under Muslim law. This chapter is about a civil law divorce. If
you want to know about a divorce under Muslim law, please go to chapter
18.

This chapter gives you some basic legal information about a civil law
divorce and to help you understand the process of a divorce. If you
decide that you want to go ahead with a divorce, it helps to have an
experienced matrimonial lawyer to guide and assist you. They can explain
the details to you and also resolve legal issues to minimize the
emotional stress for you and your family without compromising legal
results.

**GETTING A DIVORCE**

***Are you entitled to get a divorce in Singapore?***

If you are thinking about getting a divorce you need to work out if a
Court in Singapore would be able to grant it for you. Here are the
requirements for being entitled to get divorced in Singapore.

1.  Your marriage must be recognised as valid under Singapore law. If
    you got married in Singapore, your marriage is valid under Singapore
    law. If you got married somewhere else and your marriage is valid
    and registered under the law of the place where you did get married,
    your marriage will be recognized as valid under Singapore law.

2.  You usually must have been married for at least three years. It’s
    possible for the Court to make an exception to this requirement. The
    exception is where you can prove that you have suffered exceptional
    hardship or your spouse has been exceptionally unreasonable and
    cruel. The circumstances must be extreme. If you have been married
    for less than three years and you think this exception might apply
    to you, you can file a Writ for Divorce with permission from the
    Court. If you think this applies to you, you should get a lawyer to
    help advise you on your case.

3.  Either you or your spouse must be living permanently in Singapore
    when you start the Court process for your divorce. Alternatively,
    either you or your spouse must have been living in Singapore
    continually for three years immediately before you start that Court
    process. Short trips overseas during that three years are permitted.

4.  You must be able to convince the Court that your marriage has
    irretrievably broken down by proving one of the grounds of divorce –
    in other words, the reason or reasons why you should be divorced.
    See below for the possible grounds of divorce in Singapore.

**DIVORCE PROCESS**

Your divorce in Singapore will be a two-stage process.

-   Stage 1 is about the grounds – that is, the reasons – that justify
    ending your marriage.

-   Stage 2 is about a range of other things that are so-called
    Ancillary Matters. See below for information about Ancillary
    Matters.

**GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE**

***What is irretrievable breakdown?***

If you ask the Court for a divorce you must prove that your marriage has
irretrievably broken down. You do this by proving that at least one of
the following things is true on a factual basis. If your spouse asks for
the divorce, they have to prove that the marriage has irretrievably
broken down so they will have to prove one of the following things
against you.

1.  <span class="underline">Adultery </span>

> You can get divorced if your spouse has committed adultery and you
> find it intolerable to live with them.
>
> “Adultery” means one or more acts of voluntary sexual intercourse
> between a married person and a person who is not their spouse. You
> need to be able to prove that your spouse has committed adultery. You
> might need to get a private investigator to do a report to establish
> the adultery. If you get a lawyer to help you with your divorce, they
> will be able to help you with engaging a private investigator to get
> this type of report.

1.  <span class="underline">Unreasonable behaviour </span>

> You can get divorced if your spouse has behaved in such a way that you
> cannot reasonably be expected to live with them. The court will look
> at your spouse’s behaviour. It will take into account the cumulative
> effect of any behaviour.
>
> For example, this includes if your spouse doesn’t provide for you and
> your children financially. It also includes violence by your spouse to
> you and/or your children. Again, if you get a lawyer to help you with
> your divorce, they will be able to tell you from their experience in
> other cases whether the way your spouse is treating you is bad enough
> that it something that the Court will also think is “unreasonable
> behaviour".

1.  <span class="underline">Desertion </span>

> You can get divorced if your spouse has deserted or left you for at
> least two continuous years without any intention of returning. This
> needs to be where they made their own decision to leave (versus the
> two of you deciding together that they should leave or you making them
> leave).
>
> There is also “constructive desertion”. This is where you left because
> your spouse behaved in a manner that made it clear that they wanted to
> end the marriage.

1.  <span class="underline">Separation for three years </span>

> You can get divorced if you and your spouse have lived apart for at
> least three continuous years and you both agree to the divorce.
> There’s a special meaning for “continuous”, which is explained below.
> Also, it’s possible to be “living apart” but still in the same house.
> This is explained below too.

1.  <span class="underline">Separation for four years </span>

> You can get divorced if you and your spouse have lived apart for at
> least four continuous years. In this case, it doesn’t matter whether
> or not you both agree to the divorce.

Here are some important things you need to know:

-   Even if you and your spouse both “agree” to the divorce, you will
    > still need to prove one of the above five grounds for divorce.

-   You can’t ask for a divorce on the grounds of your own adultery,
    > unreasonable behaviour or desertion – it has to be the adultery,
    > unreasonable behaviour or desertion of your spouse.

-   Separation generally means that one of you has moved out of the
    > matrimonial home. However, a separation is possible even if you
    > remain in the same house for economic or other reasons. You would
    > have to show that you and your spouse were in fact “living apart”
    > under the same roof – that is, that you have not slept together,
    > that you have not shared meals, household chores, etc., that you
    > have not shared living expenses or other financial obligations.

-   If you and your spouse were separated, then resumed living together
    > for at least six continuous months and then separated again, the
    > period of separation before you resumed living together will not
    > be considered. The rule is that the required three years or four
    > years of separation starts from the beginning again at your second
    > separation. You cannot count the time of your first separation.
    > For example, if you separated for four months, then resumed living
    > together for eight months, and then separated again, then the
    > required three years or four years of separation starts at the
    > beginning of the second separation. The period of separation does
    > not include the first separation period of four months. If you
    > separate, then resume living together for **less than six months**
    > and then separate again, it is counted as if the separation was
    > continuous.

**ANCILLARY MATTERS**

Stage 2 of a divorce deals with three Ancillary Matters. The Court
decides on them unless you and your spouse are able to reach agreement
by yourselves and the Court agrees with your decisions.

1.  Maintenance: working out how much maintenance one spouse will have
    to pay the other.

2.  Matters relating to your children:

-   For example, who gets the right to make decisions over important
    aspects of their life, such as religion, education and
    medical-related issues – this is sometimes expressed as who gets
    custody of the children. It might be joint custody (you and your
    spouse reach decisions together) or sole custody (one of you makes
    the decisions). Or it might be some other arrangement.

-   Another example is who the children will live with. It’s usually
    expressed as which parent will have care and control of the
    children. This is not the same as custody. For example, the Court
    might decide that the children will live with you so you will have
    care and control, but that you and your ex-spouse will have joint
    custody of them, meaning that you and your ex-spouse will make
    decisions jointly about important aspects of their life. Closely
    related is deciding how much access you will have to your children
    if they don’t live with you and how much maintenance you will have
    to pay to your ex-spouse to contribute to their care. Or, if the
    children will live with you, how much access your ex-spouse will
    have to them and how much maintenance they will have to pay to you
    to contribute to the care of your children.

> 3) Division of matrimonial assets:

-   You and your ex-spouse will also have to work out how the assets
    acquired during your marriage should be divided. The assets
    (“matrimonial assets”), if any, include such things as your home as
    well as “CPF” funds (yours and/or your spouse’s) and other assets
    acquired during your life together.

***How to file for divorce***

If you think you want to get a divorce, you should get a lawyer to help
you. The lawyer will go through whether or not you are eligible for a
divorce and what you are required to do. If they agree that you are
entitled to get a divorce in Singapore, they will then begin to prepare
the necessary legal documents for you.

If you want to, you can conduct your divorce proceedings yourself. But
you will still need to comply with all the requirements for preparing
your documents in the correct form – proper electronic filing and
service etc. – and this can be quite difficult and therefore stressful.

***“No fault” divorce***

A “no fault” divorce is where you want a divorce and don’t have to prove
that the other spouse did something wrong. In Singapore, you and your
spouse need to live apart for at least three continuous years – see
above – to get a “no fault” divorce.

If you can’t wait for three years, then you will have to rely on any of
the other grounds to prove “irretrievable breakdown” of your marriage –
namely, that your spouse has committed adultery, displayed “unreasonable
behaviour” so that you cannot be expected to live with them or has
“deserted” you.

***Contesting a divorce***

If you rely on your spouse’s adultery, desertion or unreasonable
behaviour as grounds for getting divorced, your spouse can “contest” or
challenge it. They do this by convincing the Court that they are not at
fault. They might adopt several defences such as saying that:

-   You condoned their behaviour – for example, that you knew they were
    > having an affair and didn’t object.

-   You provoked their behaviour – for example, that the incidents of
    > “unreasonable behaviour” that you raise were your fault because
    > you provoked them or because they were retaliating to your
    > actions.

-   There was a “constructive desertion” – for example, that your
    > behaviour drove them away.

***What usually happens?***

If you want to get a divorce, you might find that your spouse will
contest your grounds for divorce, or at least threaten to contest them.
But most likely, once your spouse realises that you don’t want to remain
married to them and that you have no desire for reconciliation they will
decide not to contest the divorce.

However, your spouse might still challenge your claim for custody of the
children. They might also challenge other issues relating to “financial
settlements”, such as the division of matrimonial assets and the amount
of support and maintenance.

It makes most sense for you and your spouse to try to work out all the
troublesome issues that you are likely to disagree on, such as: Who will
raise your children? What will happen to the family home? How should
your joint assets and liabilities be divided? You can do this with the
help of an independent neutral third party called a mediator, or with
the Family Court acting as a mediator.

***When your spouse starts the process for a divorce***

If your spouse decides they want to divorce you, you will receive a
Court Order called a Writ for Divorce and several other Court documents.
You should get a lawyer to help you with the implications and
procedures. This includes contesting the divorce, if that’s what you
want to do, or even making a counterclaim against your spouse. A lawyer
will also help you with preparing and electronically filing various
documents in accordance with relevant Court procedures.

Even if you don’t want to contest the divorce, you still might want to
dispute your spouse’s claims for custody, care, control, access,
maintenance, division of matrimonial assets, or costs of the
proceedings. Again, you should get a lawyer to help you with this to
help you avoid getting treated unfairly.

You must comply with Court procedure and Court-stipulated timelines. The
Writ for Divorce will inform you of the steps you need to take and the
time within which you need to do so. Please consult a lawyer for advice
and assistance.

***Mandatory Counselling and Mediation***

If you’re going through a divorce and you have at least one child under
21 and/or if you and your spouse disagree on the divorce and/or
Ancillary Matters, you must undergo mandatory counselling and mediation
as part of the divorce proceedings. You don’t have to get counselling
and mediation if you have no children under 21 and you and your spouse
agree on everything about the divorce.

To start this counselling and mediation process you and your spouse must
attend a Family Dispute Resolution Conference (“FDR Conference”). Each
of you attends with your lawyer to meet with a Judge and Family
Counsellor. This is a preliminary discussion of issues in order to
identify and clarify them, and to set the agenda for the mediation and
counselling. Next you and your spouse must attend one or more
counselling sessions with the Family Counsellor. You may both bring your
lawyers and your child may be asked to attend the counselling session as
well.

If you have a child (or children) under the age of 21, this FDR
Conference will take place at the Child Focused Resolution Centre
(“CFRC”). Divorce has a profound impact on children. They may be
affected in many ways - emotionally, psychologically, physically,
academically and financially. The CFRC was created to better protect the
interests of children. It assists divorcing parents to focus on their
children by identifying and working towards the children’s best
interests, and to empower them with information on positive co-parenting
where parents can better make joint decisions and children can have
meaningful relationships with both parents post-divorce.

If you have no children but you and your spouse disagree on matters to
do with the divorce, you may be directed to undergo counselling and
mediation as well. This will take place in the Family Justice Courts, in
either the Family Dispute Resolution Chambers (“FDRC”) or the
Maintenance Mediation Chambers (“MMC”).

After counseling, the next step is mediation before a Judge-Mediator.
This means that the Judge-Mediator acts as a neutral third party to help
you and your spouse resolve outstanding issues amicably. You and your
spouse make the decisions, not the Judge-Mediator. Successful mediation
saves time, money and stress, and it will help you feel empowered to
make your own decisions following your divorce.

If there’s anything that you and your spouse can’t resolve there will
need to be a formal hearing and a different Judge will make a decision.
The hearing will be open to the public and could even be reported in the
newspapers.

***Hearing of the divorce – Interim Judgment***

If you want a divorce, the first thing you’ll have to file with the
Court is a Statement of Claim and Statement of Particulars. At the first
Court hearing, you must confirm its contents.

If your spouse doesn’t dispute the Statement of Claim and Statement of
Particulars and has filed a Memorandum of Appearance consenting to the
divorce your Court case will go ahead as an uncontested divorce. It will
also be an uncontested divorce if you and your spouse reach agreement on
the grounds of divorce after mediation. The next step is that once the
Judge is satisfied that there is an irretrievable breakdown of the
marriage, the Judge will grant an Interim Judgment (Divorce).

If your divorce is contested, both you and your spouse must come to
Court to give evidence to support your respective positions. This might
involve you bringing your own witnesses to Court to give support to your
position. These types of proceedings are usually lengthy and may prove
to be unpleasant. After hearing your evidence, your spouse’s evidence
and your respective witnesses, the Judge will decide whether or not the
marriage had broken down irretrievably. If so, the Judge will grant the
Interim Judgment. Otherwise, you will not be able to get divorced.

If you and your spouse agree on Ancillary Matters, the Judge can deal
with them in the Interim Judgment, otherwise the Judge will schedule a
later date to hear the contested Ancillary Matters.

***Final Judgment***

Generally, your Interim Judgment will only be made final three months
after the Court issued the judgment, or after all Ancillary Matters have
been resolved, whichever comes later.

You can only get married again after the Certificate of Making Interim
Judgment Final (“Final Judgment”) has been issued.

**14 Nullity of Marriage**

“Nullity of marriage” is a declaration by a Court that your supposed
marriage is null and void and that no valid marriage exists between you
and your partner. In other words, it is a declaration that the marriage
never happened.

A nullity (or annulment) is not the same as divorce – a divorce brings a
marriage to an end, while a nullity says that there was never any
marriage. There are two ways to apply for a Judgment of Nullity:

-   **Void marriage** – where you and your “spouse” did not get all the
    legal requirements correct when you got married so the outcome was
    that the marriage was not legal and valid

-   **Voidable marriage** – where your marriage was legal, but could be
    invalidated on certain grounds

Like a divorce, a judgment of nullity is a two-stage process. There is a
judgment of nullity, but it only becomes absolute (final) after a
further three months have passed. Then, it is as if the marriage never
took place, and both parties are free to marry.

**VOID MARRIAGES**

Your marriage is void at law – that is, i.e. not legal and valid – and
treated as if it never happened if:

-   One of you was under the age of 18 at the time of marriage and you
    didn’t get special permission from the relevant government Minister.

-   You are closely related and you didn’t get special permission from
    the relevant government Minister.

-   You got married outside Singapore and didn’t comply with the law of
    the country where you got married.

-   One of you was already married to someone else at the time of your
    marriage.

-   The person who conducted your marriage ceremony didn’t have the
    authority or valid license to do so and/or you didn’t have two
    credible witnesses.

-   You are of the same gender (as stated in your respective official
    identification documents) –a sex-change operation does not have the
    legal effect of altering gender.

A void marriage is invalid even if you don’t get a judgment of nullity.

**WHAT ABOUT THE STATUS OF ANY CHILD OF A MARRIAGE THAT HAS BEEN
ANNULLED?**

If you or your spouse believed that the marriage was valid when it took
place (even if it is later found to have been invalid) and had children
thereafter, your children are considered to be legitimate and can
therefore inherit if the parents die without a will.

**VOIDABLE MARRIAGES**

Your marriage is voidable and either you or your spouse can apply for a
judgment of nullity if:

1.  You did not have sex with each other due to one of you being
    impotent or otherwise not having the capacity to have sex.

2.  Your spouse refuses, without good reason, to consummate the marriage
    – that is, to have sex with you for the first time.

3.  You or your spouse did not consent to the marriage – that is, you or
    your spouse was subject to threats, operated under a mistake, or was
    not mentally capable of consenting.

4.  When you got married, you or your spouse was suffering from mental
    illness which made you or your spouse unfit for marriage.

5.  When you got married your spouse was suffering from sexually
    transmitted disease(s).

6.  When you got married your spouse was pregnant by another man.

For grounds 3, 4, 5 and 6, the application for a Judgment of Nullity
must be made within three years of the marriage. A child born of a
voidable marriage is a legitimate child of the parents.

If you apply for a judgment of nullity the Court will not grant it if
your spouse convinces the Court that **both** of the following
statements are true:

-   You knew that the marriage could be nullified in future, but you
    gave them the impression that you would not seek such a judgment;
    **<span class="underline">and</span>**

-   It would be unjust to your spouse for the Court to grant the
    judgment.

The reverse is true if your spouse applies for a judgment of nullity and
you wish to contest it.

**HOW DO I START PROCEEDINGS TO NULLIFY A MARRIAGE?**

To annul your marriage, you will need to file a writ of nullity in
court, together with a statement of particulars setting out the
ground(s) of annulment you are relying on. The court can refuse to grant
an annulment even if your marriage is voidable, if you do not prove your
case. Consider hiring a lawyer to help you figure out if you have
sufficient grounds and proof for annulment, and he/she will help you
draft and serve the Writ of Nullity as well.

**HOW DO I RESPOND WHEN SERVED WITH A WRIT TO NULLIFY A MARRIAGE?**

You need to decide if you want to argue about the annulment (for
example, because the reasons provided by your spouse were false or
unjustified). You need to indicate your objection to the Family Justice
Courts within eight days of receiving the Writ to nullify your marriage.
You will need to provide additional evidence to counter and/or refute
the claims made in the Writ.

You should consider consulting a lawyer for proper legal advice about
your position and for assistance in Court.

If both you and your spouse agree to the annulment it will take the
Court about four or five months to process. You will both need to go to
Court and you should consider getting a lawyer to help you with this
too.

**15 Custody of Children**

**CUSTODY, CARE AND CONTROL OF CHILDREN AND ACCESS **

***Definitions***

The Women’s Charter defines a “parent” as either the (1) natural
parents, (2) adoptive parents or (3) the formal guardians of a child.

A “child” is a child of a marriage who is under 21 years of age.

“Custody” refers to the person who is granted legal decision-making
authority. Whoever has custody of a child has the power to make major
decisions regarding him/her. For example, these may be related to
religion, education and healthcare. There are four types of custodies
that may be granted by our Courts:

> i. Sole Custody order - one parent becomes the sole decision maker.
>
> ii. Joint custody order - both parents are the decision makers.
>
> iii. Hybrid order - one parent is granted custody, however the
> non-custodial parent must still be consulted on decisions about the
> welfare of the child.
>
> iv. Split custody order - in cases where there are multiple children,
> custody of one or more of the siblings is given to one parent while
> custody of the other children is given to the other parent.

“Care and control” refers to which parent a child lives with on a
day-to-day basis and the parent who has care and control can make
decisions related to a child’s daily necessities. For example, meals,
transport arrangements and tuition. Care and control is often given to
one parent while access to the child is given to the other.

“Access” refers to the periods during which the parent who does not have
care and control is granted time to spend with the child. Our Courts
almost always grant the parent who does not have care and control of a
child, reasonable access to the child. Rarely will an order deny a
parent access to a child be given, unless clear evidence can be produced
to show access will harm the child’s wellbeing.

***Considerations for custody***

While it is common in divorce proceedings for parents to fight over
custody, care and control of their children, it is important to note
that our Courts make rulings based on what is best for the children.
Joint custody is almost always granted even though the relationship
between the parents might be difficult. However, in exceptional cases,
the Judge may feel it is more appropriate to give sole custody to one
parent (e.g. in cases of abuse).

When deciding which parent to give the custody and/or the care and
control of the child to, the Judge may also consider your wishes, the
wishes of the other parent, and the wishes of your child (if the child
is old enough to express an opinion). Commonly, our Courts will take
Social Welfare Reports into consideration.

***What can the Judge decide? ***

The Judge may, after considering the report of a welfare officer, impose
some conditions on the parent that the Judge grants custody and/or the
care and control/access of a child to, such as prohibiting a child from
being taken out of Singapore.

***Access ***

When custody and/or the care and control/access is given to one parent,
it is usual for the other parent to be given permission to spend some
time with their child on a regular basis. This arrangement is called
“access”. The Judge may deny access to the other parent if it is shown
that such access will not be in the best interest of the child. However,
this is rare.

There are two forms of access: (1) unsupervised access and (2)
supervised access. Unsupervised access is usually given. However if a
child needs to be protected from potential abuse, supervised access can
be given. Additionally, supervised access can be given in order to
assess the relationship between a child and the parent in question or if
the supervision can help improve the relationship between parent and
child. In order to determine the type of access to be given, the Court
may require Access Evaluation Reports, which will help the Court come to
a decision.

It would be best if both parents can work out a suitable, convenient and
reasonable time for access to their child. You should both decide on the
time to meet, the time and place to pick up and return your child and
the length of the meeting. After coming to a decision, both parents
should stick to the agreement. If both of you cannot come to an
agreement, you should make this known to the Judge. The Judge will make
a decision after hearing both sides, and he/she will take the following
factors into consideration: (1) the child’s wishes, (2) the parents’
previous contact with child and (3) the relationship between parents and
child.

The processes of separation and divorce will greatly affect your
children. In the interests of your child, try to compromise as much as
the circumstances permit with regard to access. As much as possible, the
innocent child should not be deprived of attention and care of either
parent.

Counselling and mediation processes are provided at the Child Focused
Resolution Centre (CFRC) attached to the Family Justice Courts. The CFRC
provides a mandatory mediation for divorcing parents in the interest of
resolving conflicts concerning children below 21 years of age.

***Taking your child out of Singapore ***

If anyone threatens to take your child out of Singapore without your
consent, you may apply to Court and obtain a Court order to prevent
him/her from doing so. If he/she disobeys the Court order, he/she may be
guilty of contempt and may be fined or imprisoned (if he/ she can be
found).

Singapore is a participant in the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects
of International Child Abduction. If a child under the age of 16 is
removed from Singapore against a parent’s right of custody to another
country that participates in the Hague Convention on International Child
Abduction, the parent may apply to the Court of that country for the
speedy return of the child to Singapore.

**16 Maintenance**

During the course of a divorce proceeding, you can ask the Court to
determine how much (if any) maintenance (financial support) to order.

When deciding on a maintenance order (whether you are entitled to an
order at all, and how much), the Court will take into account your
current economic circumstances; including:

Your financial needs or the needs of the children you are applying on
behalf of;

Your earning capacity and other financial resources or sources of
income;

Your spouse’s current income and earning capacity or other sources of
income;

Any mental or physical disabilities suffered by either of you;

Any other dependants or financial obligations borne by either of you;

The standard of living enjoyed by the family before the neglect of
responsibilities by your spouse or during your marriage (if the
application is part of a divorce proceeding).

To apply for a maintenance order during the course of a marriage, you
need to file a complaint at the Family Court, stating how much your
spouse is earning, how many dependent children you have, how much you
are applying for and in what circumstances your spouse has
neglected/failed to provide for you or your children.

The Court will order a Summons to be sent to your errant spouse and a
date will be fixed for a mediation session at the Court to see if both
parties can reach an agreement on the amount. If no agreement is reached
during the mediation session with the Court, a date will then be set for
a trial.

At the trial, the Court will hear arguments from both parties and make a
maintenance order. Any party who is unhappy with the order may appeal.
Similarly, if there is a change in economic circumstances of either
party after the order has been made, the parties may go back to the
Court to have the amount varied or changed.

**WHO CAN APPLY FOR CHILD MAINTENANCE **

Under the law, both parents are responsible for contributing to the
maintenance of their children. Biological parents, adoptive parents and
persons who have accepted a child as a member of their family are all
liable to contribute to the maintenance of children.

Applications for child maintenance can be made by:

i) The child him/herself (if they are over 21 years old);

ii) The parents / guardians or persons with actual custody of the child;

iii) Siblings who are over 21 years old;

iv) Any person appointed by the Minister

In cases where a maintenance order is required urgently, an application
can be made immediately at the Family Court without having to wait for
the commencement or outcome of the divorce proceedings.

The Court can order either or both parents to pay maintenance for the
child, and its goal is simply to meet a child’s modest, immediate
financial needs.

**CHILD MAINTENANCE **

The decision of the Court on how much maintenance to give to your child
depends on a number of factors. The Court will consider the basic
financial needs of your child such as education, financial and living
expenses. Any physical or mental disability of your child will also
affect the amount of maintenance.

Period for custody or maintenance: Usually an order for custody or
maintenance will automatically expire or become ineffective after your
child reaches his/her 21st birthday or in the matter of the child’s
maintenance, when your child is financially independent. The Court can
order maintenance for a specific period, even after your child reaches
his/her 21st birthday, such as until the completion of his/her tertiary
education or the completion of national service.

However, if your child suffers from any physical or mental disability,
the custody and/or the care and control/access or maintenance order may
continue until he/she recovers from that disability, even after he/she
turns 21.

Maintenance orders can either be a monthly allowance or a lump sum
payment. Lump sum payments may be inappropriate if it involves a huge
dose of speculation regarding the amount or if it gives the impression
that the parent-child relationship is “terminated”. Where financial
resources are in flux, periodic payments make it easier to vary the
monthly allowance where circumstances change. Periodic payments are also
more suitable when the side ordered to pay maintenance does not have the
ability to pay a lump sum.

Varying an order of custody or maintenance: You may make an application
in Court to vary or cancel the order of custody or maintenance in the
interest of your child. You may do so if there is a material or
important change in circumstances since the order was made. Examples
include where there is a substantial increase in the salary of either
parent, change in health conditions or the remarriage of one parent.

e. Agreement for custody or maintenance: You can make an agreement for
custody and/or the care and control/access or maintenance. However, the
Court may vary the agreement if it is in the interest for the welfare of
your child to do so.

**MAINTENANCE FOR WIFE OR EX-WIFE **

Singapore’s laws on maintenance largely provide for the maintenance of
wives/ex-wives. However, it is now possible for a husband/ex-husband to
apply for maintenance if he is incapacitated or ill before or during the
course of the marriage and is thus unable to earn a living and support
himself. It should be noted that one’s liability to maintain a spouse
during a marriage is different from the liability to continue
maintaining a former spouse. If you are undergoing a divorce and do not
apply for maintenance during divorce proceedings or your application for
maintenance has been turned down by the Court at the conclusion of
divorce proceedings, you may not re-apply for maintenance.

Maintenance depends on a number of factors. The Court will consider the
financial standing and earning capacity of both you and your
husband/ex-husband. The Court will also consider the standard of living
enjoyed by both of you during the marriage. Ages of the parties and the
duration of the marriage are also factors considered. The objective of
the Court is to provide modest maintenance to help you overcome your
immediate financial need. The Court will try to place you in the same
standard of living that you would have enjoyed if the marriage had not
broken down, subject to the practicalities and reasonableness of
maintaining such a lifestyle.

As in the case of child maintenance, maintenance payments can take the
form of lump sum or periodic payments. Lump sum payment may be
inappropriate where financial resources are still in flux and are likely
to change. In this case periodic payments are more suitable as the
payments can be varied as the circumstances change. Lump sum payments
would also be considered inappropriate if the husband would be crippled
financially if he had to make the payment at one go or in several
installments.

Where an ex-wife has been awarded a proportion of the matrimonial
assets, her financial requirements in the Court’s assessment of her
maintenance claim might be reduced.

**WHEN YOU CAN REQUEST FOR MAINTENANCE **

You do not have to be in a divorce proceeding to request for
maintenance. As long as you are validly married, you can seek
maintenance from your spouse (as described above) at any time during the
course of your marriage, or during or after your divorce.

**VARYING THE ORDER OF MAINTENANCE **

Either you or your husband/ex-husband may apply to the Court to vary or
cancel the order for maintenance at any time, if the circumstances under
which the original order was given have changed, whether the order was
based on a mistake of fact or whether there has been any
misrepresentation.

**ARREARS OF MAINTENANCE (MAINTENANCE OWED)**

If your husband/ex-husband has refused or neglected to pay you the
maintenance as ordered by the Court, you may proceed to recover the
arrears (maintenance you are owed) by filing an enforcement application
to the Family Court. Please consult a lawyer.

Owed and unpaid maintenance can only be recovered up to a period of
three years before the filing of the enforcement application. Any
maintenance owed in excess of the three years cannot be recovered under
such an application.

**ENFORCEMENT ORDER**

The Court has the power to impose a fine or even sentence your
husband/ex-husband to imprisonment for a term of not more than one month
for each month that he is in arrears of maintenance.

You can make your complaint at the Family Justice Court located at 3
Havelock Square. The complaint is filed in English. If you need an
interpreter, you should request for one at the Family Court. You may be
required to accompany the Process Server (a Court Officer) to serve the
Summons on your husband/ex-husband. You should find out when and where
your husband/ex-husband can be found before you file your complaint.
This would save you time and effort in serving the Summons.

On the day of the hearing, you should prepare yourself by asking the
Maintenance Counter in the Family Court to issue an updated record
showing the amount of maintenance owed to you by your
husband/ex-husband. This is so that if the enforcement order is
successful and the Judge orders your husband/ex-husband to make payments
through the Court, the correct and updated amount is shown.

**ATTACHMENT ORDER **

The Court also has the power to make an order that the maintenance be
paid by the employer of the husband/ex-husband out of his salary if he
holds a steady job and has been defaulting regularly. You should be
prepared to provide the Court with the name and address of his employer.

**17 Matrimonial Assets**

***What are matrimonial assets?***

Before matrimonial assets can be divided, it is necessary to ascertain
which assets the couple shares between themselves that can be classified
as “matrimonial assets”.

According to the Women’s Charter, matrimonial assets include:

Assets acquired <span class="underline">before the marriage</span> by
one or both parties but substantially improved during the marriage by
the other or both parties,

Assets ordinarily used by both parties and their children for various
day-to-day purposes, e.g. home, transport, household expenses etc.

Assets acquired <span class="underline">during the marriage</span> by
one party or both parties to the marriage.

If an asset was received by one party as a gift or inheritance (whether
before or during the marriage) and was not substantially improved during
the marriage, it would be excluded from the matrimonial assets liable to
be divided.

For example, matrimonial assets could include:

-   Matrimonial home (i.e. where the family lived during the marriage)

-   Family car

-   Savings

-   CPF balances

-   Shares

-   Jewellery

-   Family businesses, etc.

***Division of Matrimonial Assets***

Singapore Courts have a wide discretion in determining a proportion that
will be fair and equitable between parties, taking into account all
relevant circumstances of the particular marriage, including:

-   Extent of financial contribution by each party (i.e. in monetary
    terms)

-   Extent of non-financial contribution by each party to the welfare of
    the family (e.g. looking after the home, caring for the children or
    aged parents, etc.)

-   Needs of the children, if any

-   Any agreement between the parties on the division of matrimonial
    assets upon divorce.

The Courts will determine the division of matrimonial assets on a
case-by-case basis and there is no default position in law.

An example of an approach that the Courts have taken, to serve as a
guide, is to:

1.  Ascribe a ratio to each party based on his/her direct financial
    contributions

2.  Ascribe another ratio to each party based on his/her non-financial
    contributions

3.  Take the average of these two ratios to form the proportion of
    division.

<span class="underline">Illustration</span>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th><strong>Husband</strong></th>
<th><strong>Wife</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Direct Financial Contributions</strong></td>
<td>70%</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Indirect Non-financial Contributions</strong></td>
<td>20%</td>
<td>80%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Average Contribution</strong></td>
<td>(70 + 20)/2 = 45%</td>
<td>(30 + 80)/2 = 55%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

However, do note that the above is not a hard and fast rule and the
court will take into account numerous other factors in making necessary
adjustments.

At the end of the day, the Courts will award a division that is fair and
reasonable based on the specific facts of each marriage.

Please take note that you should organise all the documents you have in
support of your claim as these will have to be shown to the Court.
Documents may well include pay slips, CPF statements, Income Tax
assessments and documents relating to the matrimonial home amongst
others.

All parties must exercise full and frank disclosure of all known assets
they have. If a party is found to have hidden away certain matrimonial
assets, he/she will receive a lower proportion of the known assets. Upon
discovery of the hidden matrimonial assets, the aggrieved party is at
liberty to file a summons to vary the previous order which dealt with
the division of matrimonial assets.

**18 Muslim Divorce**

**GOVERNING LAW **

The Administration of Muslim Law Act (“AMLA”) (Cap 3) governs Muslim
divorces in Singapore.

**JURISDICTION **

The Syariah Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine divorces in
which all the parties are Muslims or where the parties were married
under the provisions of the Muslim law. Specifically, disputes that may
be heard by the Syariah Court must generally involve matters such as
marriage; divorces, known in the Muslim law as *fasakh*, *cerai taklik*,
*khuluk* and *talak*; betrothal, nullity of marriage or judicial
separation; the disposition or division of property on divorce or
nullification of marriage; or the payment of *emas kahwin*, marriage
expenses (*hantaran belanja*), maintenance and consolatory gifts
(*mutaah)*. In such situations, Muslim law, as varied by Malay custom,
will apply.

Note also that under section 35A of the AMLA, a person who has commenced
divorce proceedings in the Syariah Court or who has obtained a decree,
order or registration of divorce by the Syariah Court, and who now
wishes to commence civil proceedings involving the disposition or
division of property on divorce or custody of any child in another court
(e.g. in Singapore’s Family Courts), must seek permission from the
Syariah Court. Such permission may not be needed if parties consent to
the civil proceedings and attend prescribed counselling sessions.

**GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE **

Divorce by way of *Talak* (pronouncement of divorce): Generally, it is
easier for a husband to obtain a divorce as all he needs to do is to
pronounce a *talak* against the wife. The husband does not need to
provide a reason for the *talak.* A *talak* can be pronounced in a
private setting or before the Syariah Court but a private *talak* has to
be confirmed by the Syariah Court as being valid before a divorce will
be decreed. If you wish to clear any doubts on the validity of the
*talak* pronouncement, you and your spouse must attend personally at the
Syariah Court within 7 days of the pronouncement and furnish particulars
of pronouncement in Syariah Court’s Talak Declaration Form.

A wife may nevertheless apply to the Syariah Court for a divorce on the
following grounds:

1.  Divorce by way of *Khuluk* (divorce by redemption): The wife obtains
    a divorce by making an amount of payment to the husband as ordered
    by the Syariah Court in accordance with the status and means of the
    parties. *Khuluk* is usually sought when the wife is uncomfortable
    with the husband for variety of factors, but such reasons must be
    acceptable under Muslim law. This divorce can be determined only
    before the Syariah Court, subject to the couple satisfying all the
    conditions at the time of the application for divorce. The husband
    is forbidden to take advantage of this provision to cause financial
    hardship to his wife.

2.  Divorce by way of *Taklik* (breach of a condition of the marriage):
    The wife may obtain a divorce on the basis of a breach on the
    husband’s part of a term or terms of a written *taklik* made at or
    after the marriage. Such term may be specified in the marriage
    certificate, which the husband cites in the presence of a *Kadi*
    upon contracting a marriage. An example of such a term is that the
    husband physically abuses the wife. The only the Syariah Court can
    determine a divorce by *Taklik*.

3.  Divorce by way of *Fasakh* (dissolution of the marriage on valid
    grounds): The wife may obtain a divorce on one or more of the
    following grounds (per section 49, AMLA):

    1.  That the husband has neglected or failed to provide for her
        > maintenance for a period of three months;

    2.  That the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period
        > of three years or upwards and such sentence has become final;

    3.  That the husband has failed to perform, without reasonable
        > cause, his marital obligations for a period of one year;

    4.  That the husband was impotent at the time of the marriage and
        > continues to be so;

    5.  That the husband is insane or is suffering from some chronic
        > disease the cure of which would be lengthy or impossible and
        > which is such as to make the continuance of the marriage
        > relationship injurious to her;

    6.  That the husband treats her with cruelty, that is to say:

        -   Habitually assaults her or makes her life miserable by
            > cruelty of conduct even if such conduct does not amount to
            > physical ill-treatment;

        -   Associates with women of ill repute or leads an infamous
            > life;

        -   Attempts to force her to lead an immoral life;

        -   Obstructs her in the observance of her religious performance
            > or practice;

        -   Lives and cohabits with another woman who is not his wife;
            > or

        -   If he has more than one wife, does not treat her equitably
            > in accordance with the requirements of the Muslim law;

    7.  Any other ground which is recognised as valid for the
        > dissolution of marriage by *fasakh* under Muslim law.

**PROCEDURE **

1.  Registration: To start a divorce process, a party must first submit
    a completed Registration Form to the Syariah Court. The registration
    process takes about four to six weeks.

2.  Counselling: If the registration is in order, parties will then be
    required by the Syariah Court to attend mandatory counselling
    sessions conducted by the Syariah Court’s accredited partners. The
    counselling process takes about two to four months.

3.  Originating Summons stage: If, despite counselling, one (or both) of
    the parties decides to proceed with the divorce, the case will be
    referred back to the Syariah Court and the Syariah Court will fix an
    appointment for the part(ies) to file a Case Statement, which sets
    out, among other things, the ground for divorce he/she is applying
    on, in the Syariah Court. On this date, the Syariah Court will also
    generate an Originating Summons, fixing a date for either mediation
    or a Pre-Trial Conference.

4.  Mediation: At the mediation, the divorce and the ancillary matters –
    matters to do with maintenance, custody and care of children, and
    division of matrimonial assets – will be discussed with a view to
    resolving the matter at that stage. If an agreement is reached,
    parties will enter a Consent Order. If no agreement is reached, a
    Pre-Trial Conference will be fixed for parties to take further
    directions in the matter.

5.  Pre-Trial Conference: At the Pre-Trial Conference(s), the Registrar
    gives directions towards the disposal of the matter such as the
    filing of affidavits of evidence-in-chief and affidavits in-reply,
    and fixing the hearing date for the matter to be determined.

6.  Hearing: At the hearing, the Syariah Court will make orders on the
    divorce and the ancillary matters. The Syariah Court typically hears
    the issues of divorce and ancillary matters in the same hearing.

> Ancillary matters:

1.  Division of matrimonial assets: Matrimonial assets include all
    > assets acquired by the parties during the marriage (whether held
    > solely, jointly or jointly with others), assets acquired before
    > the marriage but have been substantially improved during the
    > marriage by the other party or both parties to the marriage and
    > assets acquired by gift or inheritance that have been
    > substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or
    > both parties to the marriage. In determining the issue of division
    > of matrimonial assets, the Court will have regard to a variety of
    > factors including but not limited to the financial and
    > non-financial contributions of the parties (see section 52(8),
    > AMLA).

2.  *Nafkah iddah*, i.e. maintenance for the wife for the period of
    > *iddah* or three months. In determining *nafkah iddah*, the
    > Syariah Court will take into account the means of the husband and
    > the needs of the wife.

3.  *Mutaah*, i.e. consolatory gift for the wife, normally calculated by
    > the Syariah Court on the basis of a sum for each day of the
    > marriage (the sum depends on the standard of living of the
    > parties).

4.  Custody, care and control of, and access to the children as well as
    their maintenance.

1.  *Hakam* (Arbitrator): If the wife applies for the divorce and the
    husband refuses to divorce the wife, the Court will then refer the
    matter to the *Hakam* to endeavour to effect a reconciliation and if
    a reconciliation cannot be effected, to decree a divorce.

2.  Appeal: If parties are dissatisfied with the order made by the
    Syariah Court, they may bring an appeal to the Appeal Board.

**ENFORCEMENT **

For the purpose of enforcement, certain orders made by the Syariah Court
(such as maintenance, consolatory gifts, *mutaah*, *emas kahwin*,
*hantaran belanja*, custody, and the disposition or division of
property) are treated as orders made by the Family Court that can be
enforced in the Family Court.

**19 Domestic Violence**

**INTRODUCTION**

Domestic violence, or family violence, is a problem that is often
overlooked, excused or denied. It is easy to make excuses for the ones
you love, but nobody should have to see the safety of their home
environment ruined by an abusive loved one. Domestic violence can be
psychological as well as physical. It is most often characterized by
controlling behaviour, and abusers use fear, guilt, shame, and threats
to keep control.

It is a common misconception to think that only women suffer domestic
violence. Both men and women, young and old, can suffer family or
domestic violence. This chapter applies to both genders equally. The
first step in ending an abusive domestic relationship is in noticing and
recognising that it is abusive. If you recognise your situation, or that
of a loved one in the following descriptions, please take the steps to
reach out and seek help.

**WHAT IS FAMILY VIOLENCE?**

In Singapore, family violence is when a person:

-   Intentionally puts, or attempt to put, a family member in fear of
    being hurt – ‘hurt’ means bodily pain, disease or infirmity.

-   Causes hurt to a family member by an act that they know would cause
    and result in hurt.

-   Confines or restrains a family member against their will.

-   Causes anguish to a family member through continual harassment (such
    as by verbal abuse or by psychological or emotional abuse).

Here are some examples of family violence:

-   Physical hurt such as slapping, hitting, pushing;

-   Unwanted sexual acts;

-   Insulting or humiliating a person, whether through words or actions;

-   Threatening by using blackmail, destroying property or using
    emotions to manipulate someone;

-   Unreasonable control of another person’s behaviour and activities,
    or their relationships; or

-   Preventing someone from leaving the house or a confined area.

Family violence does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence
or by way of correction towards a child below the age of 21. Your family
members are your:

-   Spouse or former spouse

-   Child, including any adopted child and/or step-child

-   Father, mother, father-in-law and mother-in-law

-   Brothers and sisters

-   Any other relative or a person who the Court thinks should be
    regarded as your family member.

**GETTING HELP**

If you are a victim, or know or suspect someone else is a victim of
domestic violence, you should seek help immediately. Here are several
ways of getting help:

1.  **Get medical attention** – See a doctor at your nearest hospital or
    clinic, and ensure that your physical injuries are recorded. This
    will give you documentary evidence of the abuse.

2.  **Report to the police** – Call the police or go to the nearest
    police centre to make a report. You will need to do this if you want
    to apply for a Personal Protection Order or Expedited Order (see
    below). The police can provide you with a referral letter to go to
    the hospital for medical examination and treatment.

3.  **Seek temporary shelter** – If you need to leave your home urgently
    to escape from family violence and you do not have any trusted
    friends or relatives that you can stay with, go to a Family Service
    Centre (FSC), or ask the police to help you find a crisis centre
    that could take you in. There are 47 Family Service Centres located
    around Singapore, please use the FSC E-Locator to find your nearest
    centre.

    **FSC E-Locator:**
    https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/familyservice/default.aspx

4.  **Apply for legal protection** – You might be able to get a Personal
    Protection Order, an Expedited Order or a Domestic Exclusion Order
    (see further information below) to protect you from your abuser. You
    can make the application yourself at Level 1 of the Family Justice
    Courts or you can get a lawyer to do it for you. If you can’t afford
    a lawyer, you can still seek help – see the list or organisations
    below or do a Google search to find other organisations, such as
    voluntary welfare organisations and Family Service Centres that give
    help for domestic violence.

5.  **Penal Code Offences** –You can only get a Personal Protection
    Order, an Expedited Order or a Domestic Exclusion Order if the
    violence is done by a family member. If you have been hurt by
    someone such as a person you are in an intimate relationship with,
    but are not married to, you will need to make a police report or get
    a lawyer to help you take out a private summons.

If your injuries are minor, you may be a victim of the offence of
“Hurt”. If your injuries are serious, you may be a victim of the offence
of “Grievous Hurt”. This includes where the violence against you has
caused you to go blind or deaf, or if it has caused you to be
permanently disfigured, or if it has caused you to have broken or
dislocated bones.

**PERSONAL PROTECTION ORDER (“PPO”)**

If you are a victim of family violence you can apply to the Family
Justice Court for a Personal Protection Order (“**PPO**”) against the
family member who is the offender. A PPO is a Court Order that says that
the family member must stop being violent towards you. It also says that
the family member must not get someone else to be violent towards you.

You will need to go through a trial before the Court grants the PPO
(unless the offender willingly consents to a PPO, which doesn’t usually
happen). If you have any medical or police reports you would show them
to the Court as evidence of the violence towards you. They will be very
useful in helping to get a PPO. If you fear facing the offender in
Court, tell a counsellor or one of the staff at the Protection Order
Services Unit. They will arrange for you to give evidence via video-link
from another location. The Magistrate or District Judge will make the
necessary orders after the hearing is over, and if you are dissatisfied
with the order, you may appeal to the High Court.

You can apply for a PPO at the Protection Order Services, Level 1 of the
Family Justice Court located at 3 Havelock Square, Singapore 059725 -
Tel: 6435 5077

If, you are unable to get to the Family Court, you can also go to any of
the following Family Violence Specialist Centres to lodge apply for a
PPO via video-link to the Family Justice Court. Applying for a PPO
through a centre allows victims to receive professional emotional
support while exploring their options:

-   **Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence (“PAVE”) **

> Blk 211 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 \#01-1446, Singapore 560211 - Tel: 6555
> 0390

-   **TRANS SAFE Centre**

> Blk 410 Bedok North Avenue 2 \#01-58, Singapore 460410 - Tel: 6449
> 9088

-   **Care Corner Project StART**

> Blk 7A Commonwealth Avenue \#01-672, Singapore 141007 - Tel: 6476 1482

The Court can also issue a Mandatory Counselling Order (“CGO”). Both
victims and offenders can be required to attend counselling
(separately). This is meant to protect the victims from future abuse and
provide them with help and support and also help the violent family
member to stop abusing you and/or other family members, including your
children.

**EXPEDITED ORDER (“EO”)**

It can sometimes take a longer time than expected before a trial for a
PPO takes place. An Expedited Order (“**EO**”) is a temporary PPO
designed to protect victims who are in immediate danger of family
violence and are waiting for a PPO trial. You would try to get an EO if
you need urgent protection and cannot wait for your PPO trial to take
place. To apply for an EO you must first complete the application for a
PPO. The Court can make an EO even without the family member who is
being violent towards you being present in court.

To get an EO, you must show that you are in imminent, immediate danger
of physical injury. The EO is valid for 28 days but the Court has the
power to extend the EO if necessary. The EO expires once the trial for
your PPO begins.

**DOMESTIC EXCLUSION ORDER (“DEO”)**

A Domestic Exclusion Order (“**DEO**”) is a drastic measure that a Court
will only make in exceptional circumstances, usually after a PPO has
been breached. Under a DEO, the Court may order the family member who is
violent toward you:

-   To leave the home; or

-   To not enter the home or to not enter some part of the home.

The DEO does not affect the offender’s ownership of the home. It only
restricts their right to occupy it or to move freely throughout it.

**BREACH OF PPO, EO OR DEO**

If an offender breaches a PPO, EO or DEO, you should make a police
report immediately.

-   Any person who intentionally or knowingly breaches a PPO or EO can
    be imprisoned for up to six months and/or fined up to $2,000.

-   A repeat offender can be jailed for up to a year and/or fined up to
    $5,000.

If the offender has assaulted you and caused you physical harm, they can
be charged for criminal offences under the Penal Code, which carry
longer, heavier sentences, namely:

-   Hurt – Imprisonment up to two years and/or fines up to $5,000.

-   Grievous Hurt – Imprisonment up to 10 years as well as either a fine
    or caning.

**20 Adoption**

**Adopting a Child in Singapore**

Adopting a child is a lifelong commitment, but being a parent and
providing a home for a child is one of the most enriching and fulfilling
experiences that life can offer. Ministry of Social and Family
Development (“MSF”) figures show that 387 children were adopted
Singapore in 2016 compared to over 700 annually about a decade ago.
About six in 10 children adopted in Singapore between 2009 and 2014 were
born overseas, mainly from neighbouring countries.

If you are thinking about adopting a child you must attend a compulsory
Pre-Adoption Briefing (a single session lasting 2.5 hours) conducted by
an MSF-accredited agency before identifying a child for adoption and
applying for a home study or making an application to the Court.

***Who can adopt a child?***

You can adopt a child in Singapore, whether or not you are married, if
you (and your spouse, if you are married):

-   Are residents of Singapore – Singapore Citizens or Permanent
    Residents, or holders of Employment Pass, Dependant's Pass or any
    other Pass which the Family Court deems as acceptable;

-   Are at least 25 years old and at least 21 years older than the child
    – but there can be an exception to this if you are related to the
    child by blood;

-   Are not more than 50 years older than the child.

If you are a single male you will not be allowed to adopt a girl unless
special circumstances exist, and if you are married but want to adopt
alone you must get permission from your spouse. These are the key
requirements. If you satisfy them and want to adopt a child, you should
check with a lawyer about the details.

***What are the first steps in identifying a child to adopt?***

If you want to adopt a child there are two ways to identify the child.

1. You can look for a child to adopt through your relatives, friends or
other contacts. You will need to get a lawyer to help you transfer the
child to you in a proper manner that does not violate the laws of any
country. You will also need to get signed consent from the child's birth
parents.

2. You can adopt a child under State care. The first step is to contact
MSF to get a home study done. Child Welfare Officers from MSF will
investigate whether you are physically, emotionally, psychologically and
financially suitable to provide for the child’s basic needs. This will
cost you about $1,500. If it’s successful, MSF will then work with you
to identify a child in State care for you to adopt.

***Who can be adopted?***

If you want to adopt a child that is a Singapore Citizen or Permanent
Resident they must be below 21 years old.

If you want to adopt a child that is not a Singapore Citizen or
Permanent Resident (including a child living in Singapore on a visit,
student's or special pass) there are the following additional
requirements:

-   You must get a home study done;

-   If it’s successful, you must apply for a Dependent's Pass for the
    child to remain in Singapore until the adoption is finalized – the
    DP is valid for nine months and the application is typically
    processed within two weeks; and

-   You must comply with any legal requirements in the country of the
    child’s residence and/or citizenship.

***How long does it take to process an adoption application?***

You should expect it to take five to seven months from the time to file
an adoption application to the time you get approval from the Court. If
you are adopting a foreign child, there will be additional time for the
home study report, the application for a Dependent’s Pass and any steps
that need to be taken in the child’s country of residence and/or
citizenship.

***How much does an adoption cost?***

In Singapore, it is illegal for you to pay the birth parents for giving
up their child for adoption. But you can reimburse the birth parents for
pre-natal and post-natal expenses, including hospital delivery bills.

If you want to adopt a foreign child you will need to check the laws in
the country of the child’s residence and/or citizenship. Paying the
birth parents for giving up their child for adoption is illegal in many
countries. In some cases, it is illegal to adopt a child and take them
to another country to live.

As part of the adoption process, you will have to give the Court a
detailed list of all financial transactions related to the adoption,
including any agent’s fees and any reimbursements or other payments to
the child’s birth parents.

***What else do you need to know?***

Check the MSF website ([www.msf.gov)](http://www.msf.gov)). It lists up to 15 steps you need to take to adopt a child, depending on whether the child is a Singapore Citizen/Permanent Resident or a foreign child.

**PART IV CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS**

**21 Arrest and Investigation**

**ARREST **

***When can you be arrested? ***

<span class="underline">Without a warrant</span>

The police can arrest you without warrant when they reasonably suspect
you of committing a serious offence (i.e. an arrestable offence) and
wish to take you into custody for investigations or to charge you in
Court. A few examples of such offences are: drug trafficking, possession
or consumption of drugs, rape, outraging of modesty, theft, robbery,
cheating, criminal breach of trust, rioting and causing serious hurt.

<span class="underline">With a warrant</span>

For non-arrestable offences, a warrant of arrest from the Court is
usually required before the police are allowed to make an arrest. In
such instances, the person arrested is entitled to be shown the warrant
and be informed of the contents of the warrant. An exception is where
the person refuses to give his/her name and residential address on the
demand of the police officer, in which case he/she may be arrested even
without a warrant.

***How is an arrest made? ***

This is done by informing you that you are arrested and by physically
holding you if you are likely to attempt an escape. In such a case, you
will usually be handcuffed. Unless you willingly submit to custody,
reasonable force may be used to arrest you. You may ask the officer for
his/her official identification and the reason for your arrest. The
police must inform you why you are being arrested as soon as possible,
although there is no specific timeline.

While the police will not generally handcuff suspects who are young
(below 16 years old) or the old and infirmed, they retain their power to
do so should they assess that the suspect could be a threat to their own
safety and/or the safety of others.

***What happens after you are arrested? ***

On arrest, you will be brought to a police station where you will be
searched and questioned. Women may only be searched by a female officer
and with strict regard for decency. Pending questioning, you may be
detained in a lock-up. You will be required to surrender whatever you
have on you (including your mobile phone, computer, vehicles). A list of
these things will be made and you will be asked to confirm it. A copy of
this list will be given to you. If the police search your residence or
workplace, they may seize anything they find as evidence. Similarly, a
list of any items seized from your residence or workplace will be given
to you and you should ensure that the descriptions of these items on the
list are accurate and that they belong to you.

Suspects below the age of 16 and suspects with mental disabilities are
entitled to be accompanied by a grown-up under the Appropriate Adult
Scheme. While the Appropriate Adults cannot advocate for the young
suspect or provide legal advice, they are independent and trained
volunteers whose job at police interviews will be to look for signs of
distress as well as to help with communication and provide emotional
support.

You may be detained for a maximum period of 48 hours from the time of
your arrest without being charged. If the officer wants to detain you
for more than 48 hours, he/she must bring you to Court for permission to
remand (detain) you for further investigations. Should the police reject
your request to engage or meet your lawyer before he produces you in
Court, you may make the same request to the judge during the Court
session. During the period where you are remanded, you may be taken out
for police searches. More on this is set out under the section “***Can
you be detained during an investigation***” below.

***Being charged for an offence after arrest ***

You may be arrested before, during or after investigation. You may be
required to give a statement. If the police decide to charge you, they
will ask you to sign a Cautioned Statement asking you to state your
defence. More on this is set out under the section on “Cautioned
Statement” below.

Being arrested is not the same as being charged for the offence. If you
are formally charged, you will be produced in Court. If you are to be
charged in Court, your fingerprints may be taken and you may be
photographed at the Criminal Records Office, Criminal Investigation
Department (“CID”). This means that there will be a record of your
fingerprints and negatives at the CID.

If you are acquitted of the offence in Court or if the charge is
withdrawn, you or your lawyer can write to the CID for the return of the
record of your fingerprints and negatives.

***Must you be told the reason for your arrest? ***

Upon your arrest, you are entitled to know the reason for your arrest.

***Telling your family or lawyer of your arrest ***

When you are arrested and detained, you can request to make a call to
your family or a lawyer telling them of your arrest. You may also
request visits by your family or a lawyer. However, these requests may
be refused if the police think that they will interfere with their
investigation. In the event you are produced in court, you may inform
the court of your intent to engage or meet your lawyer. The law allows
you to consult a lawyer of your choice.

**INVESTIGATION **

***When can you be charged in Court? ***

You can be charged in Court after investigations have been carried out.
This investigation is necessary to decide if there is any evidence that
you have committed a crime.

Who can investigate you?

-   Police officers

-   Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers

-   Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) officers

-   Immigration officers

-   Customs officers

-   Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) officers

-   Any other officers who are given the power to investigate under the
    law

***When can investigations start? ***

Investigations can begin immediately, if a police report is made against
you or if you are suspected of being involved in an offence for which
you can be arrested without a warrant.

Examples of such offences are:

-   Theft

-   Cheating

-   Housebreaking

-   Robbery

-   Extortion

-   Rioting

-   Causing serious injury

-   Taking drugs

-   Possession of drugs

-   Disturbing the peace

-   Possession of stolen property

***What can an investigating officer do? ***

Among other things, an investigating officer can:

1.  Order a person to go to a police station or other place for
    questioning and for the taking of a statement

2.  Record what you have to say and ask you to sign it

3.  Search a place and take away things to be used as evidence

4.  Seize property or possessions, which may be used as exhibits in the
    case

***Can you be detained during investigation? ***

You are generally not allowed to speak to a lawyer while you are under
investigation.

As mentioned above in “***What happens after you are arrested***”, you
can be detained for a maximum period of 48 hours from the time of your
arrest.

If the officer wants to detain you without charging you with an offence
for more than 48 hours, then he must bring you to Court before the 48
hours have ended. In Court the officer must tell the Judge the reason(s)
why he wants to detain you further. The Judge will consider the
reason(s) given and then decide whether or not you are to be further
detained.

You can ask the Court for permission to contact your family and for an
opportunity to speak with or engage a lawyer. If you feel you have been
mistreated during the investigation, you should inform the Court and if
necessary, ask for permission to see a doctor. You should also inform
the Court if you do not agree with any statements you have been made to
sign during investigation, or if the police made any promises about the
charges or sentence.

If the police do not wish to detain you further, they may let you go on
a personal promise (bond) or put you on police bail. This is to make
sure you go back to the station or attend Court when told to do so, and
in this case you will need to provide a bailor.

Your bailor may have to prove his/her means by depositing cash, fixed
deposit certificates, passbooks, car log books or title deeds to a
property, share certificates or valuables, etc. The amount of the bond
will be proportional to the severity and potential jail time of the
crime that you have been accused of.

In certain cases, bail may not be offered, for example if your release
on bail will hamper police investigation. Your chances of being released
on bail depends on several factors, including whether you have been
arrested or detained for a bailable or non-bailable offence, your flight
risk or the probability that you will appear in Court, public safety
considerations, and the necessity of preparing your defence well. Please
see the next chapter for more information on bail bonds.

***Statements ***

The law provides for the taking of two kinds of statements:

1.  Witness Statement, (or sometimes called an Investigation Statement);
    and/or

2.  Cautioned Statement from a person being charged.

Generally, if you are accused of a crime, you will be required to give
both kinds of statements. If you do not understand English, you should
inform the police officer and you will be interviewed in a language that
you understand. If you have a defence that shows you are innocent of the
offence that you are alleged to have committed, you should inform the
officer and make sure this is recorded in your statements. Before
signing any statement, read the statement carefully and make sure
everything recorded is accurate before you sign. You have the right to
amend or delete any part of your statements, but please note that
repeated amendments will mean that the Court will be less trusting of
your statements.

***Witness Statement (also known as the “Long Statement”) ***

This statement is given when the police question you about the facts and
circumstances of the case. You must answer truthfully, and if you are
found to have lied you might be charged with giving false information to
the authorities. However, you have the right to choose not to make a
statement with regard to any matter that will expose you to a criminal
charge. You can ask for permission to talk to your lawyer before giving
a witness statement, but your request may be rejected if it interferes
with investigation.

The long statement should be read back to you and you will be given a
chance to verify it. You should look through it carefully, and point out
any discrepancies for correction. You also have the right to amend any
part of your statement, but this will mean another statement given and
the Court might be less trusting if you keep changing what you have
said.

Your lawyer should request for a copy of your witness statement to be
disclosed at the Criminal Case Disclosure Conference (“CCDC”).

***Cautioned Statement ***

You are required to give this type of statement upon being charged with
an offence.

If you are charged, the investigating officer will warn you by written
notice before you make your statement. In the notice, the charge is set
out and you will be asked whether you wish to say anything in answer to
the charge. The notice also advises you to mention whatever facts you
intend to rely on in your defence at the trial. For example, if you did
not commit the crime or you were elsewhere when the crime took place,
you should say so. If you have a defence, you should always say so in
the Cautioned Statement. Your defence may not be believed if you fail to
mention it in your Cautioned Statement and choose to raise it only later
at trial. If you did not commit the offence, you should make this clear
and ensure it is recorded in the Cautioned Statement.

The charge must be explained to you. If you do not understand the
charge, you should tell the investigating officer. If you need an
interpreter to translate the questions for you into a language that you
can understand, ask for one. Please note that you have no right to speak
to a lawyer before giving or signing the Cautioned Statement.

When you say anything in your defence, the investigating officer must
record it or you may write it down yourself. This will be your Cautioned
Statement. The officer must read it over to you before you sign. If
there are any mistakes, you should insist that corrections be made even
if the investigating officer assures you that such corrections are not
important. The investigating officer should ensure that the interpreter
remains present during the signing if necessary.

You are entitled to a copy of your cautioned statement and should ask
for one if the investigation officer fails to give a copy to you
immediately after the statement. Your lawyer will advise you on how best
to proceed if you wish to correct or amend the Cautioned Statement after
consulting him/her.

***Do you have the right to remain silent when you are warned and after?
***

You may remain silent after the notice is read to you. However, if you
do not make a statement and only reveal your defence for the first time
in Court, there is a danger that the Judge may think you have
subsequently made up your defence and can decide not to believe you.
However, if you have already made a statement of the facts that support
your defence, spoken at length to the investigating officer, and made
numerous witness (long) statements over many days, your silence may not
necessarily be disadvantageous to you.

***Can everything you say be used against you at your trial? ***

Yes, if your statement was given voluntarily and is relevant to your
case.

***What is a voluntary statement? ***

A voluntary statement is one given without any inducement, threat or
promise. It is a statement given of your own free will. Your statement
is therefore not voluntary if it was made because of any promise, threat
or inducement made to you by the police or the investigating officer.

***Can you ask the police for copies of your statements or reports? ***

You or your lawyer can write to the police for a copy of your Cautioned
Statement and First Information Report. A First Information Report is
the first report received by the police about an offence, it may be a
Police Report or the transcript of a “999” call. You have to pay for
these documents. However, the police will not give you a copy of other
statements you may have made (like your Witness Statement), or
statements of other witnesses.

**22 Charge and Bail Bond**

**BEING CHARGED **

The investigating officer will fix the date for the “first mention”,
when you will be formally charged in Court. When charged in Court, the
charge will be read to you and explained by the Prosecution. If you are
charged while in remand (custody), the charge should be read and
explained to you no longer than 48 hours after your arrest.

Each offence alleged to be committed by you will be listed as a separate
charge. The charge or charges (there may be more than one charge)
against you should contain details of the alleged offence, such as date,
time, location, and the names of persons and property involved in the
offence and punishment.

You must tell the Court if you are unclear about the charge(s). If you
need an interpreter, ask for one. The Court will provide an interpreter
to translate the charge(s) into a language that you can understand.

In Court, two issues may be discussed:

1.  The issue of bail (see “***Bail bond***” below). If bail is offered,
    you will be asked to provide the bail sum, to arrange for a bailor,
    and ordered to return to Court on another specified date. If bail is
    not offered then you will be held on remand (in custody).

2.  How you are going to plead. After the charge is read and explained
    to you, you will be asked how you wish to plead to the charge. You
    can choose to plead guilty (admit to the charge) or claim trial (not
    admit to the charge).

If you are not sure of how to plead, or you wish to consult or be
represented by a lawyer, you may request the Court for some time (an
adjournment). If an adjournment is allowed, you must return on another
day. You may use this time to see a lawyer, whether by engaging a
Defence counsel or seeking one through the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme
(“CLAS”).

A charge can be amended/changed by the Prosecution and they should give
you the amended copy of the charge sheet.

**BAIL BOND **

***What is bail? ***

Bail is a security either in cash or by an undertaking given to the
Court or to the Police to ensure that once charged, you will return to
report when required. The purpose of bail is two-fold: (i) to secure
your attendance; and (ii) to minimise the risk that you will flee.

In the State Courts, all bail applications are processed by the Bail
Centre.

***When a person may be released on bail? ***

A person may be released on bail depending on the type of offence. The
offence can be bailable or non-bailable. If an offence is non-bailable,
the Magistrate or District Judge has discretion over whether or not bail
should be allowed (unless the punishment for the offence is death or
life imprisonment).

***Conditions of bail ***

Once you are on bail, you cannot leave Singapore without the permission
of the Court or the police officer. The bailor(s) (or surety) must also
give consent. Bail amount can also be increased in this situation. You
may be asked to surrender your passport to the police. Bail may also
have other conditions, such as not to commit any offence while on bail
or not to interfere with witnesses.

***Consequences of “jumping bail” ***

If you “jump bail” or fail to attend and report (either to Court or to
the police) when required, a warrant of arrest may be issued against
you. If there are no valid reasons, the bail may be forfeited and the
bailor can be ordered to pay a penalty. You may not be offered bail
again.

***The bailor’s duties ***

The bailor (or a surety) is the person furnishing security. Depending on
the amount of bail, the police officer or Court may allow for up to two
bailors. When the bailor agrees to this, he is said to be “standing
bail”. You cannot be your own bailor.

A bailor must:

-   Be at least 21 years old;

-   Not have any outstanding criminal matters against him;

-   Not be an undischarged bankrupt; and

-   Must be a citizen or a Permanent Resident of Singapore.

Bailors do not need to be a family member and can be a friend,
colleague, or representative from the Consulate or Embassy. If no
suitable bailor can be found, you will have to remain in remand prison.

A bailor has duties. He/she must follow the requirements set out on the
bail form, such as staying in contact with you, making sure that you
turn up for investigations and attend Court hearings. If you fail to
attend, the bailor has to “show cause” (or reasons and evidence) that
he/she took all reasonable efforts to contact you. You are advised to
remain in regular contact with your bailor. If you refuse to follow
their advice, they can ask the Court to relieve them of their duties and
you may be held in remand.

***Withdrawal of bailor ***

A bailor may withdraw at any time before the case is completed. If a
bailor withdraws, he/she can take back the items that he/she deposited
with the Court. This is processed by the Finance Section of the State
Courts.

If you cannot find a substitute bailor, you will be remanded (held in
custody) until you are convicted or acquitted or when a bailor steps up
to stand bail for you.

***Return of bail ***

A bailor’s duties end when the Court has made a decision. In other
words, when you are found to be not guilty of the offence (“acquitted”),
or found to be guilty of the offence (“convicted”) and sentenced.

***Amount of bail ***

The amount of bail depends on several considerations, which include: the
type of offence, severity of the offence, previous offences, number of
charges, and personal circumstances.

If bail is under $15,000, cash is not required. The bailor must make a
declaration that he has collateral of at least that amount. Acceptable
collateral includes moveable household items, including jewellery, which
are fully paid and not under any instalment plan.

If bail is over $15,000 (i.e. $15,001 or more), there are more
requirements. The bailor is required to pay the full amount into Court,
or agree to freeze part of his/her bank account.

Acceptable collateral:

1.  Physical cash/Cashier’s Order – Must be provided with copies of bank
    statement, passbook, and cheque book for the purpose of refund.
    Cashier’s Order must be payable to “Registrar, State Courts”. Cash
    bail is usually refunded within 21 working days from the conclusion
    of the case.

2.  Savings account – passbook/account statement. The account holder
    must be present. The savings account should not have pre-arranged
    GIRO transactions. The account will be frozen until the end of the
    case. It should be a solo account, unless two sureties are granted
    by Court. The accused person cannot be a joint account holder.

3.  Fixed/Time Deposit – Must be in Singapore Dollars, with minimum of
    six months to maturity. The account holder must be present and it
    must be a solo account unless the Court grants two sureties. As with
    a savings account, the accused person cannot be a joint account
    holder.

Ultimately, the High Court has the power to grant bail to any accused
person, release him/her on personal bond, or vary the amount or
conditions of the bail or personal bond as required. The High Court can
also impose other conditions for the bail or personal bond as it thinks
fit.

**23 Claiming Trial**

If you dispute the charge that has been brought against you and wish to
attend court to defend yourself, you will need to “claim trial”. You may
wish to engage a lawyer to represent you in court.

**CRIMINAL CASE MANAGEMENT SCHEME (“CCMS”) **

The Criminal Case Management Scheme (“CCMS”) takes place out of the
Courts and involves a meeting between the Prosecutors from the
Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”) and the Accused’s lawyer to have an
informal discussion on the Accused’s case. The CCMS can be initiated by
either party of the case. Here Prosecutors and the Accused’s lawyer
identify the issues in dispute and/or discuss a plea bargaining deal.
The Accused may be asked to consider pleading guilty to lessened and/or
reduced charges, which carry a lighter sentence. The Accused’s lawyer,
while taking instructions from the Accused, can also advise on matters
related to claiming trial or pleading guilty to less and/ or reduced
charges. At this stage, no Judge is present.

CCMS procedures only apply when the Accused is represented by a lawyer.
In order to take advantage of this procedure, one could consider
engaging a lawyer. The CCMS procedures run in addition to and are meant
to complement the Criminal Case Disclosure Conference (“CCDC”) and
Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”) systems (see below).

**CRIMINAL CASE RESOLUTION (“CCR”) **

If the CCMS meeting does not resolve the Accused’s case, it may proceed
to the Criminal Case Resolution (“CCR”) process. The CCR process is only
available if the Accused is represented by a lawyer and there is a
reasonable prospect of settling the case early. In a CCR, a Senior
District Judge will sit as a neutral mediator with the Prosecution and
the Accused’s lawyer to facilitate discussions on certain areas, such as
evidence and legal issues, or indicate a sentence if requested and if
appropriate.

If the Accused still wishes to claim trial, the CCR process helps to
identify which issues are in dispute and then allocate trial dates in an
efficient manner. If the Accused wishes to plead guilty, but the Accused
disagrees with the facts set out in the Statement of Facts or the
Mitigation Plea, the CCR process may facilitate a resolution.

**PROSECUTION’S DUTY OF DISCLOSURE**

In Singapore, the Prosecution has a duty to disclose any unused material
that would undermine its case and strengthen the Defence’s case. This
disclosure is necessary when the material is likely to be admissible in
court and might reasonably be regarded by the courts as credible and
relevant to the guilt or innocence of the Accused.

In addition, any unused material that is likely inadmissible but would
provide a real (not fanciful) chance of making an inquiry that leads to
material that will likely be admissible, and that might reasonably be
regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the
Accused is required to be disclosed.

Examples of such unused material that should be disclosed are
inconsistent accounts from the Prosecution’s witnesses. If the
Prosecution is aware of such material and fails to disclose them, the
consequences are serious and would amount to material irregularity
resulting in a failure of justice. If the Accused is convicted in such a
way, the conviction may be overturned.

**CRIMINAL CASE DISCLOSURE CONFERENCE (“CCDC”) **

The Criminal Case Disclosure Conference (“CCDC”) applies to offences
that are specified in the Second Schedule of the Criminal Procedure Code
2010 and will be tried in the District Court. Examples include drug
possession and trafficking, vandalism and computer hacking.

CCDCs may apply for other offences if all parties give their consent.
These CCDCs will apply when the Accused does not plead guilty.

If the Accused’s lawyer advises that there may be a CCDC for the
Accused’s case, the Accused can instruct him/her on whether or not the
Accused wants to be part of this process. It should be noted that the
Accused can take part in a CCDC even if he/she is not represented by a
lawyer.

The purpose of a CCDC is for the Prosecution and the Accused’s lawyer to
settle the following matters before going to Court:

1.  To set out the Case for the Prosecution and the Case for the Defence

2.  Issues of fact or law on which the trial Judge is to decide

3.  List of witnesses to be called by the Prosecution and the Defence

4.  The statements, documents or exhibits which both Prosecution and
    Defence intend to admit at trial

5.  The trial date

The Case for the Prosecution should contain what they intend to rely on
at the Accused’s trial. These include, the charge(s) which the
Prosecution intends to proceed with at the trial, a summary of the facts
in support of the charge(s), list of names of the witnesses for the
Prosecution, list of exhibits that the Prosecution wants to admit at the
trial, and any statement the Accused made at any time that was recorded
by an officer of a law enforcement agency,

The Case for the Defence should contain the following:

-   A summary of the facts used in the Defence

-   A list of the names of witnesses the Accused and/or his/her lawyer
    wishes to rely on

-   A list of exhibits the Accused’s lawyer intends to submit

-   Any objections if available, and issues of fact or law\* in support
    of such an objection.

\*If the Accused is not represented, there is no need to state objection
to any issue of law of the Prosecution’s case, or raise any point of law
that supports such an objection.

Generally, if an accused is charged and he does not plead guilty, the
first CCDC will be held eight weeks from the decision not to plead
guilty. The case for the Prosecution should be served no later than two
weeks from the first CCDC. Subsequently, the second CCDC should occur no
earlier than seven days from date that the Prosecution’s case was filed.
If the Accused does not plead guilty during the second CCDC, the Case
for the Defence should be filed within two weeks from the date of the
second CCDC. The Prosecution should serve its supplementary statements
and exhibits within two weeks from the filing of the Case for the
Defence. A third CCDC will be held after this step. Trial dates will be
fixed on the third CCDC. Please see Chapter 25: Trial and Appeal, for
more information on the trial process.

**PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE (“PTC”) **

If you do not plead guilty and decide to claim trial to the charge, the
case will be fixed for a Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”). The purpose of a
PTC is to settle administrative matters in relation to a trial and to
ascertain if the case is ready to proceed. PTCs apply if there are no
CCDC procedures or if the Accused pleads guilty after the first
mentions.

A centralised PTC Court usually hears PTCs, and a Judge will be present.
The Criminal Mentions Court will inform the Accused which Court his/her
PTC will be held at during the first and second mentions. The case
usually stays in the Mentions Court for six to eight weeks before
proceeding to PTC. However if the circumstances require, a PTC can be
scheduled as early as one week from the 1<sup>st</sup> mentions.

At the PTC, the Court will inquire into and/or deal with the following
matters:

-   Whether the Accused is pleading guilty or electing to claim trial to
    the present charges. The Court will want to be updated on timelines
    and progress regarding the Accused’s case.

-   If the Accused is pleading guilty, the Court may provide directions
    for the Prosecution to forward a draft Statement of Facts (“SOF”)
    before the date of pleading guilty.

-   The Accused’s lawyer may advise on whether to tender a written
    Mitigation Plea (to lighten the Accused sentence) or do so verbally.

-   If the Accused is claiming trial, and the case is one that qualifies
    for CCDC, a CCDC date will be fixed. The Court may enquire into
    other issues that need to be resolved, such as time required for
    obtaining reports (i.e. medical, forensic, toxicology, psychiatric,
    or other expert reports). A list of witnesses and documents to be
    relied on should be produced.

-   If the Accused’s lawyer briefs the Court with an update of
    representations made to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (the “AGC”)
    on the Accused’s behalf, the Court will give directions for him/her
    to submit further representations to the AGC.

If you decide to claim trial without engaging a lawyer, you will have to
attend the PTC yourself. At the PTC, you should address the following
matters:

-   Find out if the prosecution will be using any written statements
    given by you to the police – if so, you may request for a copy of
    those statements.

-   Inform the Judge the number of witnesses that you intend to call at
    trial in support of your defence.

-   If you or any of your witnesses do not speak or understand English,
    you should inform the Judge that you require the assistance of an
    interpreter for the trial.

Once the case is ready for trial, the Judge will fix a hearing and you
will be informed of the date, time and place.

**REPRESENTATIONS **

The Accused’s lawyer makes representations on the Accused’s behalf.
Representations can be made verbally or in the form of a letter written
to the Prosecution at any stage of proceedings, including before the
Accused has been charged. The representations are meant to ask the
Prosecution to review its case against the Accused.

Representations are written to the Prosecution as soon as possible and
cannot be made after the Accused has admitted to the charge and the
statement of facts and entered an unconditional plea of guilt. The Judge
will not know of the contents of the representations. Verbal
representations are possible but are usually only resorted to after
counsel receives last minute instructions or discovers new information
that casts a different light on the case.

The Accused’s lawyer, depending on the case, can request the following
in relation to the charge or anticipated charges:

1.  Withdraw the charge whether amounting (or not) to an acquittal.

2.  Withdraw the charge and issuing a stern and/or conditional warning.

3.  Amend (change) the charge based on the Accused’s personal
    circumstances considering the severity of the crime. This includes
    reducing the charge(s) to a lesser offence in the same class of
    offences, particularly where the Accused does not have a valid
    Defence.

4.  Take into consideration (“TIC”) charges for sentencing purposes
    (i.e. the accused agrees to plead guilty to certain charges in
    exchange for the Prosecution withdrawing other charges or having
    them “taken into consideration” to reduce sentencing.

5.  Ask the Prosecution for its position on sentencing.

6.  Negotiate with the Prosecution to come up with a common Statement of
    Facts, which is an objective summary of the facts of the charge
    (more on this in the next chapter).

After taking the Accused’s instructions, the Accused’s lawyer will ask
or write to the Prosecution to raise certain legal issues, facts and
circumstances surrounding the charge(s). Providing false information to
a lawyer when giving him instructions carries serious consequences, and
is punishable with imprisonment.

The Prosecution may decide to agree to the contents of the
representations, to impose conditions or to reject the contents of the
representation. If the contents of the representations are rejected, the
charges against the Accused remain. The Accused can instruct his/her
lawyer on whether they wish to claim trial, plead guilty or make more
representations on their behalf.

**24 Pleading Guilty, Mitigation and Sentencing**

**PLEADING GUILTY **

Pleading guilty means that the Accused admits fully and unconditionally
that he committed the offence that he has been charged for.

If the Accused wishes to plead guilty, a plead guilty mention will be
arranged by the court. An accused is able to plead guilty to the charge
against him either when he’s first charged in court, after a Pre-Trial
Conference (“PTC”), or Criminal Case Disclosure Conference (“CCDC”).

*<span class="underline">Statement of Facts (“SOF”)</span>*

The Statement of Facts (“SOF”), which is prepared by the Prosecution, is
supposed to be a complete and objective summary of the facts of the
charge, its particulars, and how the offence was committed. It also
helps the Court to determine the appropriate sentence for the Accused.
If the SOF fails to disclose every element of the case, the Prosecution
will be given time to amend the SOF – the court cannot acquit the
Accused simply because the SOF was incomplete.

Upon receiving the SOF, the Accused should go through the facts with the
Accused’s lawyer and instruct him on their accuracy. If the Accused
disputes any of the facts contained in the SOF, he/she should make this
clear to his/her lawyer. Usually the Defence Counsel is given the
opportunity to check the charges before the SOF is obtained.

*<span class="underline">Disagreements with the SOF</span>*

If the Accused does not agree to some important facts in the SOF, or the
Prosecution disagrees with some parts of the Accused’s mitigation plea
(to reduce the sentence), a “Newton Hearing” may be held. A Newton
Hearing is a type of mini-trial to determine factual issues and is
necessary if there is a big difference on the question of facts about
the case that are relevant to sentencing.

*<span class="underline">Responsibility of the Accused</span>*

Regardless of whether an Accused is represented by a lawyer, the Accused
must understand the nature and consequences of pleading guilty and be
prepared to accept whatever punishment the Court may give. Leniency may
be shown if the Accused pleads guilty at an early stage.

*<span class="underline">Plea must be Complete</span>*

The Court will ask whether the Accused agrees or disagrees with the SOF,
totally or in part. Pleas of guilt must be made without qualification,
which means the Accused must accept the details as set out in the SOF.
If the Accused disagrees with the SOF on important issues, the Court
will not accept the Accused’s guilty plea and will direct him to claim
trial to the charge. If the Accused agrees fully to the SOF, the Court
will record the Accused’s guilty plea and convict him. The conviction
will be recorded and any conviction/sentence forms a criminal record.

*<span class="underline">Withdrawal of Plea of Guilt</span>*

The Accused may only withdraw the his/her guilty plea in very special
circumstances, such as if he/she is able to demonstrate that he/she did
not know the consequences of pleading guilty, did not know the elements
of the offence, or was pressurized into pleading guilty. If the case is
over and the court has finished sentencing, the correct procedure to
withdraw a guilty plea would be to file a Petition of Criminal Revision
and ask for the Conviction to be set aside.

If the Accused is a youthful offender who is eligible for punishment by
probation or reformative training, the Court can call for both probation
reports and reformative training reports during which time the Accused
may be remanded.

If an offence is punishable by death, the Prosecution will be required
to prove its case at trial – a plea of guilt shall not record a guilty
plea unless the Accused has been committed to stand trial in the High
Court.

***Mitigation ***

A mitigation plea is where the Accused’s lawyer tries to persuade the
Judge to lighten the Accused’s sentence after he pleads guilty.

A mitigation plea usually happens on the day that the Accused pleads
guilty, and the Accused’s lawyer essentially asks the Court to be
lenient by stating specific reasons why the Court should consider giving
a lighter sentence than it normally would; for example, family
background, educational qualifications, medical history, employment
history and other personal circumstances .

The Court looks at factors like:

1.  When the Accused pleaded guilty;

2.  The Accused’s remorse;

3.  Whether this was the Accused’s first crime;

4.  The Accused’s willingness to “restore” the victim to the position
    he/she was in before the crime (e.g. repayment);

5.  No serious harm to victim;

6.  Cooperation with the police;

7.  Whether the Accused planned to commit the crime and/or prepared to
    do so with others; and

8.  Long-standing good character.

Supporting evidence is useful for these purposes. The Court will also
ask the Accused if he/she wishes to state any facts or circumstances to
explain the reason(s) why they committed the offence and why the Court
should be lenient. If the Accused has pleaded guilty, he/she can take
this opportunity to explain themselves and plead for leniency.

The Prosecution can object to the mitigation plea. If they do, the
Defence will have to withdraw the relevant parts of the mitigation plea
or provide proof that they are acceptable. The Defence can also call
witnesses to provide evidence for its mitigation plea. If the
Prosecution does not object to the assertions made by the Defence, the
court is entitled to accept them and give such weight to them as it
thinks fit.

**SENTENCING **

***Sentencing principles ***

If the Accused has pleaded guilty or if the Court finds him guilty, the
Court will decide on the appropriate sentence guided by the principles
of retribution, deterrence, prevention, proportionality and public
interest. The main thinking and purpose behind sentencing is to reduce
crime, and to protect the community.

In considering the appropriate sentence, the Court considers:

-   What sentences were given in previous cases of the same kind;

-   The type of offence;

-   The Accused’s personal circumstances;

-   The likelihood of the Accused re-offending; and

-   How big a role the Accused played in committing the crime.

Before the Court decides on a sentence, the Prosecuting Officer may
apply to read a Victim Impact Statement so that the Court may assess the
effect of the offences on the victim before deciding on an appropriate
sentence.

Depending on the circumstances of the case, some types of sentences can
run concurrently (at the same time), or consecutively (one after
another). The Court is bound by Section 307 of the Criminal Procedure
Code to order the sentences for at least 2 of the offences to run
consecutive if a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for
at least 3 distinct offences in that occasion.

If the Accused has pleaded guilty but is dissatisfied with the sentence,
they must file a Notice of Appeal against the sentence within 14 days.
On appeal, the sentence may be increased or decreased, and bail amount
is likely to be increased.

***Sentencing options ***

Depending on the case and the circumstances and whether or not there are
previous convictions, the sentencing options for adults are:

-   Fine

-   Imprisonment

-   Police supervision

-   Preventive detention

-   Corrective training

-   Caning

-   Community sentences and orders

-   Death penalty

-   Probation (in special circumstances)

Both female offenders and elderly offenders above the age of 50 are not
subject to caning. The overall punishment must be equal to the overall
gravity of the criminal conduct.

For youthful offenders between 16 years and 21 years of age, probation
and reformative training are possible sentences.

For offenders with mental disabilities, community based sentences are
available, including a mandatory treatment order.

***Community Based Sentences***

Community based sentences do not involve incarceration. Youthful
offenders and mentally unwell accused persons may qualify for community
based sentences. Community based sentences are meant to wean young
offenders away from a life of crime and reform and rehabilitate them
into self-reliant and useful citizens. This is possible because the
chances of effective rehabilitation for young offenders are greater than
in the case of adult offenders. A Court appointed psychologist and a
social worker that works with the Community Court will assess the case
to determine the suitability of sentencing and they will follow-up
post-sentencing.

There are 5 basic orders that the court can make:

1.  Mandatory Treatment Order

2.  Day Reporting Order

3.  Community Work Order

4.  Community Service Order

5.  Short-Detention Order

***After sentencing ***

After sentencing, the Court may order that a sentence start from the
date that the Accused was put in remand.

There are different prison rules and regulations that control remission
(one-third sentence discount) and the Home Detention Scheme. The Court
does not decide these matters.

Property that may have been seized by the police may or may not be
returned. Once in prison, letters to and from family/friends are
screened, and there can be a total of two prison visits every month.

**25 Trial and Appeal**

**TRIAL **

***Claiming trial ***

If the Accused decides to claim trial to the charge, the case is fixed
for a Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”) (see Chapter 23: Case Management). At
the PTC, the Court will inquire into matters that need to be resolved
and fix a date for trial after outstanding issues are ironed out. The
Accused may be required to furnish Court bail.

If the case is one that falls under the Criminal Case Disclosure
Conference (“CCDC”), there are timelines to follow (see Chapter 23: Case
Management). Essentially, the Prosecution has to give the Accused and
his lawyer the Case for the Prosecution, which contains all charges,
statements, witnesses and evidence that the Prosecution intends to use
at the trial. After this, the Accused’s lawyer must give the Court and
the Prosecution the Case for the Defence, which should also contain the
Defence’s, lists of witnesses, exhibits, and objections (if any) on
matters in the Case for the Prosecution.

***Procedure at trial ***

The Prosecution will present their case first. The Prosecution will
state the nature of the offence the Accused has been charged with, and
the evidence that he/she is relying on to prove that the Accused is
guilty. The Prosecution will call their witnesses to give evidence by
asking them questions (this is called the “examination-in-chief”).

After the Prosecution finishes asking his/her questions, the Defence
will be given a chance to ask the same witness questions in order to
challenge the evidence given (this is called the “cross-examination”).
For example, the Defence may present a different version of the events
to the witness and asking if he/she agrees with it, or rely on
documentary evidence to contradict the evidence given by the witness.

After cross-examination, the Prosecution may ask further questions in
order to clarify some of the answers given by the witness during the
cross-examination (this is called the “re-examination”).

After the Prosecution concludes its case, the Accused’s lawyer may
request the Court to dismiss the case against the Accused on the ground
that there is no case to answer. The Prosecution may respond to this.
The Court may alter the charge and frame a new charge at this stage, and
the Accused can plead guilty to this different or new charge.

Upon the close of the Prosecution’s case at the trial, the Court will
decide if the Prosecution has presented a strong enough case. If the
Judge is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence which, if accepted,
may support the charge(s) against the Accused, the Accused will be asked
to present his/her Defence (including calling any witnesses and
producing any documentary evidence). If no Defence is presented, the
Accused may be found guilty and convicted.

However, if the trial Judge finds that the Prosecution’s evidence in
support of the charge is lacking, or if he/she is not convinced of the
Accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt after an examination of the
evidence, then the Court must acquit the Accused, i.e. find him/her not
guilty.

If the Accused’s lawyer raises a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s
case, then the Accused may be acquitted and released. If not, he will be
found guilty and convicted. Alternatively, the Court may consider the
actions that warrant conviction under a revised charge.

***Witnesses ***

The Accused must ensure that the witnesses testifying in the Accused’s
Defence attend the trial when they are required to testify. If the
Accused is unsure about whether the witness is willing to turn up, an
application at the Crime Registry may be made for a Summons to a Witness
to be issued, at a nominal fee.

***Court decorum ***

When attending Court, a jacket is recommended and singlets, shorts,
slippers and shabby or scanty dressing should be avoided. The Judge must
be addressed as “Your Honour”, the Prosecution as “the learned
Prosecutor” and any witnesses by their surname, i.e. “Ms Tan”.

The Judge or Prosecutor should not be interrupted when they are
speaking. If a point needs to be raised, the counter-party should always
stand and wait for the Judge or lawyer to finish speaking before they
ask for permission from the Court to raise further points.

***Subpoena ***

A subpoena is an order for a person to attend Court on a specified date
and time to give evidence as a witness or to produce documents.

If a subpoena is issued to anyone, it is compulsory for that person to
attend Court on all days ordered by the Court until the case is
completed. If the party fails to attend without valid excuse, he/she
will be found guilty of contempt of Court and may be fined or
imprisoned.

A person who receives a subpoena may contact the firm of solicitors that
served him/her the subpoena to speak to them to discuss the case, and
he/she may be asked to write a statement that is to be given in Court.
He/she may find out from the solicitors when it is necessary to attend
Court and may also let them know whether an interpreter is required.

**APPEAL **

If the Accused is dissatisfied with a conviction, he/she may appeal
against it. If the Accused has pleaded guilty to a charge and is
dissatisfied with the sentence, he/she may appeal against the sentence
only. An appeal may be made for any judgment/sentence/order if there is
any error in law, or error in fact, or if the sentence imposed is
manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate.

If the Accused wishes to appeal against conviction or sentence, he/she
should inform his/her lawyer immediately and file a Notice of Appeal.
Pursuant to the Notice of Appeal, the Judge will release the “Grounds of
Decision and the Accused should study the Grounds of Decision carefully
before deciding whether he/she should proceed with the appeal. If the
Accused decides to proceed with the appeal, he must file a Petition of
Appeal within 14 days of the release of the Grounds of Decision. The
Notice of Appeal and Petition of Appeal are to be filed at the Crime
Registry. Under normal circumstances, the Court would address the issue
of bail and the bail amount pending appeal when the Accused informs the
Court of his intention to file an Appeal.

The Prosecution can also appeal against a sentence and/or conviction.

There is no right of appeal to some orders made by the court. These
include:

1.  Order refusing stay in proceedings

2.  Interlocutory ruling/order

3.  Grant of bail order by District Judge

4.  Any order made in any CCDC

Appeals against decisions originating in the State Courts will be heard
by the High Court, and such appeals are known as Magistrate’s Appeals.
These appeals are usually heard by a single judge, but the Chief Justice
may direct a hearing before 3 or more judges of an uneven number. Once
the High Court has made a judgment on a Magistrate’s Appeal, the
judgment is final and there is no further right to appeal to the Court
of Appeal except questions on points of law or public interest

Appeals against decisions originating in the High Court will be heard by
the Court of Appeal. These appeals are usually heard by 3 judges but the
Chief Justice may direct hearing before 5 or more judges of an uneven
number.

Appeals before 3 or more judges must be decided on majority.

**26 Magistrate’s Complaint and Private Summons**

**MAGISTRATE’S COMPLAINT **

Criminal proceedings in court can be initiated via a Magistrate’s
Complaint. A Magistrate’s Complaint is a criminal complaint filed by a
person that has a good reason to believe that a crime has been committed
against him/her by another person. The person submitting the “Complaint”
should do so in a standard Magistrate’s Complaint form, accessible via
the State Courts’ website:

([*https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/CriminalCase/Documents/MagistrateComplaintForm.pdf*](https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/CriminalCase/Documents/MagistrateComplaintForm.pdf))

The completed form must be submitted to the Complaints Counter of the
Crime Registry on Level 1 of the State Courts, together with a copy of a
police report (if any), and a photocopy of your NRIC. A fee of $20.00 is
payable once the completed form is submitted. The Complaints Counter of
the Crime Registry also keeps standard Magistrate’s Complaint forms in
hard copy format.

The person making the complaint is known as the “Complainant” and the
person against whom the application is made is known as the
“Respondent”.

The Magistrate will examine the Complainant who must affirm or swear to
the truth and accuracy of the matters stated in the application form.
The Magistrate may then do the following:

1.  Issue a summons to compel the attendance of anyone to help him
    determine whether there are sufficient grounds to proceed with the
    complaint.

2.  If the identity of the Respondent is unknown, the Magistrate may
    direct the police to ascertain the particulars of the Respondent and
    thereafter issue a summons to both the Complainant and Respondent.

3.  Direct the police to conduct an investigation into the Complaint.

4.  Refer parties to mediation in Community Mediation Centres.

5.  Postpone consideration of the matter to enable parties to try to
    resolve the Complaint amicably.

6.  Dismiss the Complaint.

If the Magistrate does not dismiss the complaint and has a reasonable
suspicion that an offence has been committed, he/she must issue a
summons for the Accused (Respondent) to attend court and if necessary
can issue a warrant for arrest.

***Criminal Mediation***

If a Notice is issued to both the Complainant and the Respondent, it
means that the matter is fixed for Criminal Mediation, and the Crime
Registry prepares a notice to inform parties of when it will take place.
The Complainant must attend. Otherwise, the Magistrate (Judge) will
strike out the Complaint.

At the Criminal Mediation, the following can happen:

1.  The Magistrate may refer both parties to a Court Mediator, or to the
    Community Mediation Centre where there are a panel of trained and
    respected mediators. If there is an agreement after mediation the
    parties can sign a Settlement Agreement. If there is no agreement,
    there will be a fresh Notice with another date to appear before the
    Magistrate.

2.  Any person who fails to comply with the order of the Magistrate made
    under (a.) shall be guilty of contempt of court and action may be
    taken against him under section 8 of the State Courts Act (Cap.
    321).

3.  The Magistrate may also mediate the matter. If there is no
    settlement agreement here, the Complainant may wish to proceed to
    trial by way of a Private Summons (there is a small fee payable for
    each Summons).

For a flowchart on the filing of a Magistrate’s Complaint, see the State
Courts’ depiction below.

<img src="./assets/images/image3.png" style="width:7.06494in;height:6.92907in" />

**PRIVATE SUMMONS **

If the Magistrate hearing the Complaint is not able to get the parties
to settle and the Complainant wishes to proceed, the Magistrate or Judge
will give directions on when the Complainants need to draw up and serve
charges on the Defendants.

The Complainant pays a nominal sum ($20.00) for the issuance of the
Private Summons.

Essentially, the Complainant will then prosecute these cases (usually
through his/ her appointed counsel). Complainant needs to bear his own
legal costs if he engages a lawyer to conduct the matter.

If the private summons ends in acquittal (i.e. the Defendant is found
innocent), the Public Prosecutor’s permission is required if the
Complainant wants to appeal the decision.

***Service of Summons ***

The Complainant must formally serve (deliver) the Summons on the
Respondent. This is to give the Respondent notice of the Complaint
started against him.

Method of service is either by personal service to the Respondent by
hand, or by the Complainant along with an authorised person (usually
Court Process Server or appointed lawyer on behalf of the Complainant).

If personal service is not possible, Court’s approval for an alternative
suitable method for service should be obtained.

A Private Summons cannot be served on a Respondent who resides outside
Singapore.

If the Complainant is unable to determine the Respondent’s current
address, the Complaint cannot proceed.

***Hearing of Summons ***

Once the Summons is served, there is a hearing. If the Respondent pleads
guilty, the Court immediately passes a sentence. If there is a trial,
parties have to give their respective cases, evidence (including the
calling and cross examination of witnesses) and arguments in open Court.
The Court will decide whether the Respondent is guilty of the offence(s)
charged.

If the Respondent does not turn up on the day of the trial, the Court
may issue a Warrant of Arrest against him.

**PART V EMPLOYMENT MATTERS**

**27 Employment Rights **

**EMPLOYMENT LAW **

The Employment Act (“EA”) sets out your rights and obligations as an
employee.

You are an employee under the EA, unless you are a person employed as a
seaman, a domestic worker or in a managerial or executive position.

In general, managers and executives are employees with executive and
supervisory functions, whose duties usually include: influencing or
making decisions on recruitment, discipline, termination of employment,
performance assessment and reward; formulating strategies and policies
of the enterprise; and managing and running the business. They also
include professionals with tertiary education and specialised knowledge
or skills whose employment terms are like those of managers or
executives. For example, this includes lawyers, accountants, dentists
and doctors.

Singapore law does not require any specific form of employment contract
to be entered into by an employee and an employer. Employment contracts
need not even be in writing, although a written contract is customary
and the terms and conditions of employment for both EA and non-EA
employees will generally be set out in the employment contract or
contract of service. The terms for EA employees must not be less
favourable than those provided for by the EA.

**SALARY **

Under the EA, your salary must be paid at least once a month (not
necessarily on the first day of a calendar month) and within the first
seven days of each salary period. All salary must be paid in legal
tender and can be paid into your bank account or by cheque to you. If
your employer does not comply with the above, he is guilty of an offence
and can be fined or jailed.

***Employers’ Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) contribution obligations
***

Employers are prohibited from requesting that their employees waive CPF
contributions. All CPF contributions must conform to the rates
stipulated in the CPF Act, based on the employees’ wages.

**CONDITIONS OF WORK **

The following protections and privileges will be applicable to you if
Part IV of the EA applies. Part IV applies to workmen earning not more
than $4,500 per month and employees (other than workmen) earning not
more than $2,000 a month. Generally, a workman is someone whose work
involves mainly manual labour. Part IV provides employees protections
and privileges for rest days, hours of work, holidays, annual leave,
payment of retrenchment benefit, priority of retirement benefit, annual
wage supplement and other conditions of service.

1.  <span class="underline">Working hours </span>

    1.  Generally, you are not required to work more than eight hours a
        day (or 44 hours a week). There are, however, exceptions to this
        general rule.

    2.  You can:

        -   Work for nine hours in one day (but still not exceeding 44
            hours a week), if you agree to work less than eight hours a
            day on one or more days, or work five (or less) days a week.

        -   Work for no more than nine hours a day (but still not
            exceeding 44 hours a week), if you work less than five days
            a week;

        -   Work for 48 hours a week (or 88 hours over two weeks), if
            you agree to work less than 44 hours every alternative week.

        -   Work unlimited hours and on rest days, if there is an
            accident, or if the work is essential to the life of the
            community, defence or security, or if there is urgent work
            to be done to machinery or plant, or an interruption of work
            was impossible to foresee.

> If you work more than the hours above, you are working overtime.

1.  <span class="underline">Overtime </span>

> You cannot do overtime work for more than 72 hours a month. If you
> work overtime, you should be paid at least 1.5 times your “hourly-rate
> of pay”. Payment for overtime work must be made within 14 days after
> the last day of the salary period.

1.  <span class="underline">Rest time </span>

> You are entitled to have at least one rest day a week which need not
> be a Sunday. You are allowed to have a rest period after working
> continuously for six hours. However, if the nature of your work is
> such that it must be done continuously, then you must have a 45-minute
> meal break within eight hours.

1.  <span class="underline">Shift workers </span>

> As a shift worker, your hours of work may differ from those of other
> workers. Section 38 of the EA sets out the standard working hours for
> non-shift workers (discussed in “Working hours” and “Overtime”).
> Section 40 sets out the working hours requirement for shift workers.
>
> Under the above provisions:

-   You can be required to work more than six consecutive hours without
    a break, or more than eight hours (but not more than 12 hours) a
    day, or more than 44 hours a week, but not more than an average of
    44 hours per week over a period of three weeks.

-   You can claim overtime if you work more than an average of 44 hours
    per week over a period of three weeks.

> You must consent in writing to working on shift. Sections 38 and 40 of
> the EA must be explained to you; otherwise, your consent will not be
> valid.

1.  <span class="underline">Annual leave </span>

> If you have served an employer for over three months, you will be
> entitled to seven days’ paid annual leave for the first 12 months of
> continuous service with the same employer, and an additional one day’s
> paid annual leave for every subsequent 12 months of continuous service
> with the same employer, coming to a maximum of 14 days annual paid
> leave in addition to the rest days, holidays and sick leave that you
> are entitled to under sections 36, 88 and 89 of the EA respectively.
>
> Your employer can forfeit (take away) your annual leave if you absent
> yourself from work for more than 20% of the number of working days in
> the month or year or are dismissed on the grounds of misconduct.

1.  <span class="underline">Retrenchment and retirement benefits </span>

> <span class="underline">Retrenchment </span>
>
> Your employer can retrench you if you are no longer needed or if there
> is a reorganisation of the business. Your employer need not give any
> reasons and he cannot be stopped from employing new workers after a
> retrenchment exercise. Retrenchment benefits are payable only if your
> contract of service (or a collective agreement if you a union member)
> says so, or if your employer decides to pay you “ex-gratia”
> (gratuitous) retrenchment benefits.
>
> Your employer will also have to give you notice of retrenchment.
> Affected employees should be informed of the impending retrenchment
> before notice of retrenchment is given. The duration of notice will
> depend on what is laid out in the contract of service. If the notice
> period is not specified, it will be the period as set out under the
> section below on “Termination of Contract of Service”.
>
> <span class="underline">Retirement </span>
>
> The EA states that if you have worked for less than five years with
> your employer, you are not entitled to any retirement benefits. The
> EA, however, does not state that you are automatically entitled to
> retirement benefits if you have worked for at least five years with
> your employer. The amount of retirement benefits is not stated in the
> EA and must be negotiated between yourself (or your trade union) and
> your employer.
>
> The Retirement and Re-employment Act (“RRA”) came into effect on 1
> January 2012. Its objective is to provide employees with the

> the eligibility criteria, namely if the employee:

-   Is a Singapore citizen or Singapore permanent resident.

-   Has served the current employer for at least 3 years before
    turning 62.

-   Has satisfactory work performance, as assessed by the employer.

-   Is medically fit to continue working.

-   Is born on or after 1 July 1952.

> the older employee an Employment Assistance Payment (“EAP”).

**TERMINATION OF CONTRACT OF SERVICE **

***Termination on notice ***

In general, an employment contract may be terminated on notice given by
either party (unless the contract is for a fixed term). EA employees
must be given (and must give) notice in writing. The period of notice
for either you or your employer to terminate your contract of service
should be stated in your contract. It should not be less than the
following guidelines in the EA:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Period of employment </strong></td>
<td><strong>Period of notice </strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Less than 26 weeks</td>
<td>Not less than 1 day</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>26 weeks but less than 2 years</td>
<td>Not less than 1 week</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2 years but less than 5 years</td>
<td>Not less than 2 weeks</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5 years or more</td>
<td>Not less than 4 weeks</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For managerial/executive level employees, where the employment contract
does not provide for a notice period, then “reasonable notice” must be
given. As to what constitutes “reasonable notice”, factors such as the
nature of the employment, qualifications of the employee and period of
employment may be considered. In practice, the employer may refer to the
notice period applicable to other employees in the same category as the
employee in question.

Either you or your employer can choose to waive (abandon) your right to
notice. Either party can also choose not to wait for the notice period
to expire. In this case, the party who does not wish to wait for the
expiry of the notice period must pay the other salary in lieu of notice.

There is no legal requirement to state the reason for termination with
notice, so long as the termination is effected in accordance with the
employment contract.

***Termination without notice ***

Notice of termination need not be given if there has been a wilful
breach of the terms and conditions of the contract of service. For
example, if your employer fails to pay your salary within seven days
after it is due, or if you feel that you have been asked to do something
which involves danger, violence or disease which is not included in the
contract of service, you may leave your employment without giving
notice. (It is advisable to seek advice from your lawyer or the Ministry
of Manpower before doing this). On your part, your employer need not
give you notice of termination if you absent yourself from work for more
than two days without prior leave or without reasonable excuse or
attempting to inform your employer.

In this circumstance, your employer can do one of the following instead
of dismissing you:

-   Instantly downgrade you; or

-   Instantly suspend you without pay for a period not exceeding one
    week.

***Summary dismissal (Immediate dismissal)***

In most cases, the employment contract specifies the “cause” or grounds
on which the employer may summarily (immediately) terminate employment,
not all of which need to be fault-based (e.g. bankruptcy is a common
ground for summary dismissal). The employer must ensure that the
situation it intends to rely on falls within the wording of the
specified grounds, and that there is evidence to prove such grounds on
at least a balance of probabilities.

In addition, as long as the contract does not explicitly prevent the
employer from doing so, an employer is entitled to rely on section 14(1)
of the EA to summarily dismiss you if your conduct is inconsistent with
the conditions of the contract.

***Procedure for summary dismissal ***

There is no statutory procedure to be followed for summary dismissal,
other than “due inquiry”. Though the EA does not specify what
constitutes “due inquiry”, Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) guidelines
prescribe that the employee must be told of the allegations against him
and be given an opportunity to explain himself. The Tripartite
Alliance’s guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (“TAFEP”) also
provide that a decision to dismiss an employee should be based on
properly documented proof of poor performance or misconduct.

In addition, if any procedure leading to dismissal is set out in the
employment contract, such as a disciplinary procedure, the employer must
comply with such procedure.

***Appealing against termination ***

Employees who feel that they were unfairly terminated can appeal to the
Minister of Manpower within one month of dismissal. If the termination
was carried out with notice and in accordance with contractual terms,
the employee must be the one to prove that the dismissal was done
“without just cause or excuse”. This means that an employer failed to
provide good reason for the termination (e.g. poor performance) and did
not communicate his concern to the employee prior to termination. If
unfair dismissal is proven, the Minister may order payment of
compensation or (rarely) reinstatement by the employer.

**MATERNITY/CHILDCARE LEAVE **

Under the Child Development Co-Savings Act (“CDCA”), female employees
are entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternity leave (4 weeks immediately
before and 12 weeks immediately after delivery), provided that the
conditions set out in the CDCA are met. An employee who is covered under
the EA but not under the CDCA will be entitled to 12 weeks of maternity
leave – of which 8 weeks are paid leave.

Some general rules apply:

-   To be entitled to gross pay during maternity leave, you must have
    worked for your employer for at least 3 months before delivery of
    the child.

-   You must inform your employer at least 1 week before you commence
    your maternity leave and also inform your employer of the date of
    when confinement begins. If you fail to give notice without good
    reason for doing so, you will only be entitled to half pay.

-   It is illegal for your employer to ask you to give up your maternity
    leave, or to terminate your contract while you are on maternity
    leave.

-   During maternity leave, you are not allowed to claim sick leave,
    unless it is provided for in the employment contract.

-   Employees who meet the eligibility criteria under the CDCA will also
    be entitled to childcare, paternity, shared parental and adoption
    leave provided under such laws, a summary of which is set out in the
    next page.

**BONUS **

Bonus is a one-time payment usually paid to employees at the end of the
year to reward them for their contributions to the company.

Payment of bonus is not compulsory. However, it is a contractual
obligation for the employer to pay bonus if it is provided for in the
employment contract or collective agreement.

**MAKING A COMPLAINT **

If you have any disagreement with your employer about your salary, the
terms of your contract or your rights under the EA, you can make a
complaint to the Ministry of Manpower. The fee for making a complaint is
$3.00.

You must do so within one year from the date the incident you are
complaining about occurred. However, if your complaint relates to
matters surrounding termination of your contract, you must lodge your
complaint within six months from the date you left your employment.

The Commissioner will then summon the party complained against and
conduct an inquiry into the complaint. Prior to this, the Commissioner
may hold a preliminary inquiry where parties are given a chance to
settle the matter. If a settlement is reached, the Commissioner shall
make the settlement an order and the order will be effective without
further inquiry.

If the two parties cannot reach a settlement, an inquiry into the
complaint will go ahead. At the inquiry, the Commissioner will hear
evidence from all sides of the dispute and then make the necessary
order. The order can be to dismiss the claim or to order a party to pay
a sum of money to satisfy the claim. This order can be made in the
absence of one party if that party fails to attend the inquiry.

Any party not satisfied with the Commissioner’s order can appeal to the
High Court within 14 days of the decision.

**28 Work Injury Compensation Act**

**WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU ARE INJURED WHILE YOU ARE AT WORK? **

If you are injured while you are at work, you can make a claim under the
Work Injury Compensation Act (“WICA”). WICA is administered by the
Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”).

WICA aims to provide a quick and simplified process for obtaining
compensation for workplace injuries. The alternative is an expensive and
time-consuming civil lawsuit against your employers. It is optional to
engage a lawyer, as you do not need one to complete the claim process.
MOM will guide you through the claim process.

Unlike civil lawsuits against the employer, compensation is payable
under WICA on a “no-fault basis”, as long as an employee suffers an
injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. There is also
a fixed formula in the Act on the amount of compensation to be awarded,
and the amount is capped so that the financial liability on the employer
is limited. If you make a claim under WICA, you cannot make a claim for
the same injury by commencing a separate civil lawsuit.

**WHO CAN CLAIM COMPENSATION UNDER WICA? **

Anyone who sustains injuries or who contracts occupational diseases
arising out of his/ her work, or the estates (inheritors/dependants) of
employees who die in a work-related accident, are entitled to claim work
injury compensation. WICA covers all employees engaged under a contract
of service or apprenticeship, regardless of their salary.

Notable Exceptions – Self-employed persons, independent contractors,
domestic workers, members of the Singapore Armed Forces, officers of the
Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Civil Defence Force, the Central
Narcotics Bureau and the Singapore Prison Service are not covered by
WICA.

**WHAT IS COVERED UNDER WICA? **

You can make a claim under WICA for personal injury by accidents arising
out of and in the course of your employment – i.e. arising during
working hours or while on official duties, including accidents that
happen while travelling to and from your place of work in
company-provided transport (not by public transport), and injuries
sustained abroad while on overseas assignments. Claims not covered by
WICA include deliberately self-inflicted injuries and injuries under the
influence of alcohol or drugs not prescribed by doctors.

**WHAT ARE THE COMPENSATION BENEFITS UNDER WICA? **

Depending on the case, you or your inheritors/dependants are entitled to
claim:

1.  Medical expenses, including medical consultation, hospitalisation,
    treatment and surgery, artificial limbs and surgical appliances;

2.  Compensation for Permanent Incapacity or Death; and/or

3.  Wages while on medical leave.

The amount that you are entitled to claim is subject to the maximum
amounts set out by WICA.

**WHAT ARE THE LIMITS / THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT CAN BE CLAIMED UNDER
WICA? **

1.  <span class="underline">Medical expenses</span>:

-   Must be incurred within one year from the date of the accident;

-   Up to a cap of $36,000 per accident.

1.  <span class="underline">Permanent Incapacity</span>:

-   The maximum amount payable is $262,000 X (% permanent incapacity);

-   The minimum amount payable is $88,000 X (% permanent incapacity);

-   The percentage of permanent incapacity depends on the severity of
    the disability suffered.

1.  <span class="underline">Death</span>:

-   The maximum amount payable to your dependants is $204,000;

-   The minimum amount payable is $69,000.

1.  <span class="underline">Medical leave wages</span>:

-   Full pay up to 14 days outpatient medical leave and full pay up to
    60 days hospitalisation are payable.

-   Once this limit is reached, two-thirds of your salary is payable up
    to a maximum period of one year following the date of the accident.

**WHAT IS THE TIME LIMIT FOR FILING A CLAIM UNDER WICA? **

The time limit for filing a claim with the MOM is one year from the date
of the accident. After this one-year period, you will no longer be able
to file a claim under WICA.

**WHAT IS THE PROCEDURE FOR FILING A CLAIM UNDER WICA? **

For <span class="underline">non-permanent incapacity cases</span>,
report the accident to your employer and seek compensation for medical
leave wages and medical treatment related to the work accident.

For <span class="underline">permanent incapacity cases</span>, the
general steps for filing a claim under WICA are as follows:

***Step 1 ***

You must report the accident to your employer. Once MOM has been
notified of your accident, MOM will send the claim application form to
you. You should then submit the claim application form to MOM within one
year from the date of accident.

***Step 2 ***

You are required to undergo a medical examination to assess the extent
of the injury. Your employer will submit the Medical Report Form for
Work Injury Compensation to the treating clinic or hospital and pay the
requisite medical report fees.

***Step 3 ***

The treating clinic or hospital will send the completed medical report
to the MOM; upon which the MOM will assess the compensation amount and
issue a Notice of Assessment (which states the amount of compensation
payable) to you, your employer and your insurer. If you wish to object
to the amount of compensation, you must fill in the objection form and
send it to MOM within 14 days of the date that the Notice of Assessment
was sent to you. The MOM has discretion whether or not to accept
objections filed after the 14-day period. (Please see the section on
below on disputing a work injury claim for more information.)

***Step 4 ***

If there are no objections to the Notice of Assessment, the assessment
is final and conclusive on the 15th day and your employer has 21 days
from the date of service of the Notice of Assessment to pay you the
assessed compensation amount.

**DISPUTING A WORK INJURY CLAIM**

If you feel that the assessed compensation amount is unfair or
inaccurate, you can file a dispute within 14 days from the date of the
Notice of Assessment. Disputes can be filed by the employee, the
employer or the insurer.

There are two main types of disputes you can file in a work injury
claim:

-   Objection to the permanent incapacity assessment;

-   Other objections, e.g. whether an injury was work-related, or
    whether the average monthly earnings indicated in the Notice of
    Assessment is correct.

If you object to the permanent incapacity assessment, once you have
filed your dispute, your injuries will be re-assessed by a panel
appointed by the Work Injury Compensation Medical Board. The objecting
party will have to pay the Medical Board a fee of $357 and the costs of
any tests required by the board. If the fee is not paid in time, the
objection may be struck off. The Medical Board’s permanent incapacity
assessment is final.

For all other kinds of disputes, the MOM will hold a pre-hearing
conference and the objecting party will have to provide supporting
documents and evidence. Please note that without evidence the objection
may be struck off. If the dispute cannot be resolved at the conference,
the case will be referred for a hearing.

Once the dispute is resolved, MOM will issue a Court Order to all
parties and your employer/insurer have 21 days to pay the compensation.

**29 Making a Will and Intestate Succession**

**WHAT IS A WILL?**

A Will is a formal document that gives instructions about who will get
your assets – your “estate” – when you die. If you don’t make a Will
before you die, you are “intestate” and legal rules will apply to work
out who should get your estate. It’s important to make a Will – it means
that you are in control of who will get your assets when you die.

**SOME TERMS YOU SHOULD KNOW**

There are some technical words that apply to a Will and also where there
is an intestacy. Here’s what they mean:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>“Testator”</td>
<td>If you are the person making a Will, you are called the “Testator”. You are “Testate” if you make a valid Will before you die.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>“Beneficiaries”</td>
<td>Your beneficiaries are the people who your Will says will receive your assets – in other words, they are the people who will inherit or benefit under your Will.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>“Executor”</td>
<td>There are various administrative things that need to be done before your beneficiaries get your assets. For example, there needs to be a Grant of Probate. Also your debts need to be paid and sometimes at least some assets in an estate need to be converted into cash by being sold. The person who does these things is called your “Executor”.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>“Probate”</td>
<td>“Probate” or a “Grant of Probate” is what happens when your Executor applies to a Court for permission to administer your estate according to your Will. For example, it includes the Court checking that your Will is genuine.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>“Trustee”</td>
<td>You also need someone to carry out the instructions in your Will about who will get your assets. The person who does this is called your “Trustee”. You might decide to appoint the same person as the Executor and Trustee.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>“Intestate”</td>
<td>If you die without a valid Will you are “intestate”.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>“Letters of Administration”</td>
<td>If you are intestate, an application has to be made for a Grant of Letters of Administration. The Court will appoint “Administrators” to administer your estate. They do more or less the same job as an Executor and Trustee would do if you were Testate.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**WHO CAN MAKE A WILL?**

You can make a Will if you are at least 21 years of age and mentally
fit. You can change your Will at any time. Changes at least every few
years are usually a good idea so that who will get your assets reflects
your domestic and family circumstances. For example, when you first make
a Will you might want your children to inherit from you. But later on in
life, you might want your grandchildren to inherit from you too.

You can make your own Will and change it at any time without getting a
lawyer to help you. But, the risk is that your homemade Will doesn’t
match certain technical legal requirements. If this happens, your
beneficiaries may suffer unnecessary expense as well as distress. To
avoid this, it’s better to get a lawyer to help you and draft your Will
for you according to the law.

If you are a soldier in active military service, or a mariner or a
seaman at sea, you can make a Will even if you are below 21 years of
age.

**WHO CAN YOU APPOINT AS YOUR EXECUTOR/TRUSTEE?**

In Singapore, an Executor and Trustee must be at least 21 years of age
and they must not be an undischarged bankrupt. Usually, you would
appoint a family member or a close friend to be your Executor and
Trustee. It’s best if you choose someone who has some understanding of
your financial position and assets so they can carry out the
instructions in your Will effectively.

You can appoint more than one Executor and Trustee – you can have two or
more joint Executors and Trustees. You can even have a substitute or
alternate Executor and Trustee, especially if you think that your first
choice of Executor and Trustee may die or lose mental capacity before
you die.

**WHO CAN YOU NAME AS YOUR BENEFICIARIES?**

It’s up to you who inherits your assets – family members and/or your
friends and/or even an organisation (such as your favourite charity).
For example, you might decide to give most of your assets to your close
family members, to give some gifts to your closest friends and to give a
gift to an organisation that supports a cause of particular interest to
you.

Your need to clearly state the names of people and organisation in your
Will by including their full name and identification number or, if you
don’t know their identification number, their address and other
information that might identify them with certainty.

You can give your assets to children and young people. If you do, it’s
usually better to have at least two Executors/Trustees. This is because
they need to administer or hold any assets for the benefit of these
minor beneficiaries until they reach 21 years of age.

Your Will should not be witnessed by someone who is a beneficiary under
it.

**WHAT ABOUT THE CARE OF YOUR CHILDREN?**

As a parent you, or you and your spouse, can appoint a guardian for your
children. The appointment is made by including the guardianship in your
Will. It comes into effect if you (or your spouse) dies before a child
reaches the age of 21.

If you die and your spouse is still alive:

-   Your spouse has the right to guardianship of your children.

-   Your spouse can exercise his/her sole right to guardianship even if
    you appointed a guardian.

-   Alternatively, your spouse can choose to exercise their right to
    guardianship jointly with any guardian you appointed in your Will.

This rule is also applies if your spouse dies and you are still alive.

Where there is a joint guardianship and there is a dispute between the
guardians, a Court will resolve it. The Court has to decide the dispute
based on “the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount
consideration”. In other words, a Court would always decide on your
child’s guardianship or upbringing based on your child’s best interests.

**DISTRIBUTING YOUR ASSETS**

You can leave specific assets or specific sums of money to a named
beneficiary. For example, you could say in your Will that:

-   All your shares in ABC Pte Limited be given to your business partner
    in ABC Pte Limited (specifying their name and identification
    details).

-   Your house at a specified address is to be given to your niece.
    However, please note that if the house you live in is in your name
    and your spouse’s name and is a “joint tenancy”, it automatically
    passes to the surviving spouse when the other spouse dies, and your
    niece will not receive any portion of the house, even if the Will
    grants your house to your niece. “Joint tenancy” and related terms
    are explained further below.

-   $100,000 is to be given to each of your children.

-   Your art collection is to be given to a specified welfare society.

Alternatively, you can leave all your assets – your entire estate – to
one or more people in certain percentages. For example, your Will could
give your entire estate to your spouse and only child in equal shares or
it could give half of your estate to your spouse and the other half to
your three children in equal shares.

**WHAT ASSETS CAN YOU INCLUDE IN A WILL?**

With the exceptions mentioned below, your Will can include assets that
are in your sole name – for example, your house, car, shares, proceeds
from your insurance policies, monies in your bank accounts, cash and
jewellery.

**WHAT ASSETS CANNOT BE INCLUDED IN A WILL?**

You can’t include assets in your Will if they don’t legally belong to
you. Also, there are special rules about your CPF, about certain types
of insurance policies and about assets you own jointly with someone
else.

***Money in your Central Provident Fund (“CPF”)***

You cannot give away your CPF Ordinary, Special, Medisave and Retirement
Accounts, or any discounted SingTel shares, by including them in your
Will. You have to do this separately by something called a “nomination”.
You can get a Nomination Form from the CPF Board’s website. You will
need to sign it, and sign it in the presence of two witnesses who will
also sign the Form. They must both be at least 21 years old. Neither of
them can be people you are nominating to get some of your CPF assets.
Then you send the signed nomination form to the CPF Board.

If you don’t follow this nomination form process, your CPF assets will
be distributed as if you were intestate (died without a will), even if
you have included them in your Will. (We talk about intestate
distribution later in this chapter.)

If you make a CPF nomination and then get married, that CPF nomination
is automatically revoked (i.e. it is no longer valid). Therefore, you
should make a new nomination after you get married.

If you get divorced after making a CPF nomination, your CPF nomination
is not automatically revoked. So if you do get divorced, you should
think about whether or not it would affect your earlier CPF nomination
and if so, decide if you wish to revoke it.

You can revoke your CPF Nomination by completing a Notice of Revocation
of Nomination Form that you can get from the CPF board’s website. Again,
you need to sign it in the presence of two witnesses over the age of 21,
who also have to sign it. Then you need to send it to the CPF Board.

***Insurance policies***

Some insurance policies say that an amount will be paid when you die –
this is called “death benefits”. If you have an insurance policy with
death benefits, you can nominate a beneficiary/beneficiaries so that the
insurance company knows who you want the death benefits to go to. If you
nominate beneficiaries, you can still change them at a later date.

If you haven’t nominated any beneficiaries, the death benefits will be
distributed under your Will, even if you don’t mention the insurance
policy or the death benefits in your Will. The same thing happens if you
nominate “the estate” as the beneficiary of the death benefits instead
of naming any specific beneficiaries.

If you die without leaving a valid Will and without nominating
beneficiaries to the insurance benefits, there will be an intestate
distribution. We talk about intestate distribution later in this
chapter.

*<span class="underline">How death benefit nominations work</span>*

If you nominate beneficiaries to the death benefits of your insurance
policy, the way that they work depends on whether or not you nominated
those beneficiaries before 1 March 2009. If you have changed the
beneficiaries of your death benefits before, this applies to the most
recent change in nomination. If you aren’t sure about the date you did a
nomination, check with the insurance company and they will tell you the
nomination date.

<span class="underline">Nominations made before 1 March 2009</span>

If you nominated beneficiaries to receive the death benefits from your
insurance policy before 1 March 2009:

-   The death benefits will be distributed in accordance with your
    nomination.

-   This happens even if you later made a Will with different
    beneficiaries for the death benefits.

The technical reason for this is that the nomination created a statutory
trust that cannot be revoked, even if you got divorced after the
nomination.

<span class="underline">Nominations made on or after 1 March 2009</span>

If you nominated beneficiaries to receive the death benefits from your
insurance policy on or after 1 March 2009, you have the option of making
a “revocable nomination” (i.e. the nomination can be cancelled), or a
“trust nomination” that is non-revocable (i.e. it cannot be cancelled).

-   Trust (Non-Revocable) Nomination: In this type of nomination, the
    person (or persons) that you nominated to receive your death
    benefits will be entitled to receive them even if you subsequently
    execute a Will giving the death benefits to someone else. In other
    words, a Will has no effect in changing the beneficiaries named in
    the Trust (Non-Revocable) Nomination, and those beneficiaries will
    be entitled to the death benefits upon your death. You may only
    revoke (cancel) such a Trust (Non-Revocable) Nomination in your
    lifetime if you obtain the written consent of all the beneficiaries.

-   Revocable Nomination: In this type of nomination, you are free to
    change, add or remove nominees without their consent. If you make a
    Will after making a Revocable Nomination, and in that later Will you
    specifically dispose of your death benefits from the insurance
    policy in question, the terms of your Will would prevail over the
    Revocable Nomination. In other words, if you make a Will giving your
    death benefits to beneficiaries who are different from those stated
    in the Revocable Nomination, the death benefits would be paid to the
    beneficiaries stated in the Will and not those in the Revocable
    Nomination.

When preparing your Will, it is therefore extremely important for you to
be aware of:

-   Who you have nominated to be the beneficiaries of the death benefits
    under each of your insurance policies;

-   Whether any nominations you have previously made can be revoked; and

-   Whether you can legally alter the beneficiaries of such death
    benefits by your Will.

***Joint assets***

A “joint asset” is something that you and someone else own together –
i.e. the asset is in two (or more) names. A husband and wife having a
joint bank account or joint ownership of a residence are common
examples. Sometimes a parent owns an asset jointly with their children.
Sometimes siblings or friends own an asset jointly.

What happens to a joint asset when you die depends on two things:

1.  Is the joint asset is “immovable property” (for example: land, a
    unit in a condo or a HDB flat)?

2.  Do you and your joint owner (or owners) own the immovable property
    as “joint tenants” or as “tenants in common”? (We say more about
    “joint tenants” and “tenants in common” below.)

<span class="underline">Joint assets that are not immovable
property:</span>

If you have a joint asset and it is not immovable property (e.g. a bank
account), when one <span class="underline"> </span> owner dies the other
owner owns the whole asset. <span class="underline"> </span> For
example, if you and your spouse have a joint bank account and one of you
dies, the other one is entitled to all the money in the account. Lawyers
call this the “right of survivorship” – the surviving owner gets the
share of the asset of the owner who has died. It makes no difference
whether or not you include such a joint asset in your Will. It makes no
difference whether or not you even have a Will. The right of
survivorship almost always overrides everything else.

<span class="underline">Joint assets that are immovable property:
</span>

If you are planning on acquiring immovable property, you (and the other
owner(s)) will first need to decide if you will own it as “joint
tenants” or as “tenants in common”. This, and the specific share of each
owner, is stated on the title documents to the immovable property – that
is, on the Certificate of Title. You need to decide if you will own as
“joint tenants” or as “tenants in common” because the consequences are
different when one of you dies. Here’s how this works:

-   <span class="underline">Joint tenancy</span>: Joint tenancy is the
    more usual position for owning immovable property. If you own
    immovable property jointly and hold it in a “joint tenancy”, each of
    you share equal ownership and have an equal right to the whole
    property. It’s common for spouses to hold the family home as joint
    tenants – if one of them dies, the other automatically owns the home
    by themselves due to the right of survivorship (i.e. the surviving
    owner gets the share of the owner who has died).

-   <span class="underline">Tenancy-in-common</span>: If you own
    immovable property jointly and hold it in a “tenancy-in-common”,
    each of you share ownership in agreed percentages. For example, you
    might own a 60% share of an investment property and
    friend/investment partner owns the remaining 40%. You might have
    agreed these percentages because you put in 60% of the money and
    your friend/investment partner only put in 40% of the money. For
    this reason, when you die, you probably want your spouse and/or
    children to get your 60%, rather than it going to your
    friend/investment partner. In the same way, when your
    friend/investment partner dies, you probably expect their
    beneficiaries to get their 40%, rather than it going to you.

Spouses can hold the family home as tenants-in-common if for some reason
they don’t want the right of survivorship to apply. But holding
immovable property as tenants-in-common happens more often in a business
setting, such as for an investment property. The right of survivorship
does not apply. You (and your co-owner(s)) would include your ownership
interest in the immovable property in your Will. If you don’t have a
valid Will, your ownership percentage of the immovable property will be
distributed intestate. (We talk about intestate distribution later in
this chapter.)

**ASSETS NOT DISPOSED OF IN YOUR WILL**

It’s possible that you have a valid Will when you die but that it
doesn’t deal with all of your assets. In that case, there will be an
intestate distribution of your assets that are not covered by your Will.
(We talk about intestate distribution later in this chapter.) This
scenario is known as “partial intestacy”. To avoid it happening, you
need to include a clause – technically, it’s called a “residuary clause”
– in your Will so that it deals with all the assets you hold when you
die.

**VALIDITY**

In Singapore, a Will is not valid unless:

-   It is in writing (it can be handwritten or typed in the form of a
    document but a verbal declaration of what you want to do with your
    assets doesn’t work);

-   You, the Testator, have signed it; and

-   At least two people watched you sign it and sign the Will as well–
    there are strict rules about these witnesses (see below).

In Singapore, your Will doesn’t have to be in English, but the first
thing that will need to be done after you die is that your Executor will
need apply to Court for a Grant of Probate in order to administer your
estate according to your Will. This can’t be done until there is an
official English translation of your Will, and that usually adds costs
and delays that are stressful for families. As such, Wills in Singapore
are mostly in English – the Testator can get a formal translation in
their own language prior to executing the Will or they can get help from
an interpreter. The translator’s name and identification number should
also be written on the Will.

**WITNESSES TO YOUR WILL**

You must sign your Will while two people – your witnesses – watch you
doing so. They must then sign the Will while you watch them do so and
while they watch each other sign.

Your witnesses should not be beneficiaries under your Will. Also, they
should not be the spouses of any of the beneficiaries under your Will.
If you break this rule any clause in your Will giving a gift to the
person or their spouse will be void – in other words, it won’t work and
they won’t get the asset(s) that you wanted to leave to them.

The first thing that will need to be done after you die is that your
Executor will need to apply to Court for a Grant of Probate. The Court
might check if the above requirements about signing and witnessing have
been followed exactly. To do this, the Court may require the two
witnesses to give evidence about how the Will was signed by you and
them. The full names and identification numbers of the two witnesses
(and the interpreter) should also be written on the Will.

**CHANGING YOUR WILL**

Never attempt to change your Will by crossing parts out or adding words
in or by attaching anything to it. It won’t work and might also mean
that your entire Will may become invalid. If you want to change your
Will, you should either make a new Will or make a Supplemental Will (the
technical name for a Supplemental Will is “a Codicil”).

If you make a new Will, destroy the originals and copies of any previous
Wills. This is to avoid any confusion about which Will is the correct
one. This is good practice even if the new Will says that it cancels out
the previous one. Otherwise, your family might locate only the earlier
Will and not the latest Will which expresses your most recent
intentions. This can be fixed if the latest Will is later found, but
fixing it comes at a financial cost and may also come at an emotional
cost for your beneficiaries.

**REVIEWING YOUR WILL**

Usually, if you get married (or remarried) your Will is automatically
cancelled. This might not happen if your Will says that you are making
it because you are getting married (or remarried).

You should review your Will if:

-   you change your name or anyone mentioned in the Will changes their
    name;

-   an Executor or Trustee dies or becomes incapable of carrying out
    their duties owing to ill-health;

-   a beneficiary dies;

-   you subsequently sell or part with any property mentioned in the
    Will; or

-   there is any significant change in circumstances (such as when you
    acquire property or assets which have not been mentioned in your
    Will).

You should review your Will regularly.

**MAKING YOUR WILL KNOWN**

A Will is a private document. But it is important that your family and
especially your Executors know that you have a Will and where you have
kept it. It is not advisable to lock your will in a safe. You can get a
lawyer to look after it for you and then give your Executor(s) your
lawyer’s name and address.

You can also register your Will at the Wills Registry. This is
maintained by the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office. It doesn’t
accept copies of the Will so the contents remain confidential, instead
it keeps details of where the Will is held. Registration is voluntary,
but it’s a good idea because after you die it provides a simple way for
your loved ones to find out where your Will is held – for example, it
could give them the identity of the Executor or lawyer who has it been
holding it for you.

**BENEFITS OF LEAVING A WILL**

Here are the main benefits of having a Will:

-   You decide who gets your assets. You specifically order which people
    get what assets and in what proportion or shares. If you are a
    Muslim, you can only dispose of one third of your assets in your
    Will – the rest is done under an Inheritance Certificate issued by
    the Syariah Court; please see Chapter 32 for more information on
    Muslim inheritance laws.

-   You decide who your Executor will be – i.e. a person who you trust
    and who will be responsible for carrying out your instructions in
    your Will.

-   You can appoint guardians for your children. This is particularly
    important for your children’s welfare in case both you and your
    spouse die suddenly while they are still young. It means you can
    appoint a person that you both trust to bring up and care for your
    children properly.

-   A Grant of Probate is always faster and easier than going through
    the equivalent process in the case of intestacy. (Intestacy is
    discussed in the next section.)

**INTESTACY: WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT MAKE A WILL (NON-MUSLIMS)**

If you die without a valid Will, you are said to have died “intestate”.
If you die intestate, live in Singapore, and are not Muslim, your assets
will be distributed according to Singapore’s “rules of intestacy”.

Under those rules of intestacy, your assets will generally be
distributed to your family members and descendants in the following
priority:

-   First, to your spouse, children, grandchildren (and other
    descendants);

-   Second, to your parents;

-   Third, to your brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces;

-   Fourth, to your grandparents; and

-   Fifth, to your uncles and aunts.

“Child” refers to legitimate children – that is, children born to a
woman when she is validly married, or children who are born
illegitimately but whose parents subsequently marry. It also includes
any child legally adopted in Singapore, Malaysia or Brunei. In other
words, illegitimate children do not get anything under the rules of
intestacy.

If a person is divorced, their ex-wife/husband is not a “spouse” and do
not get anything under the rules of intestacy.

Here is table and flowchart to help explain the rules of intestacy. Your
lawyer can advise you about these rules and how they apply to you.

If you die without a valid Will:

-   Some or all of your assets might go to people to whom you do not
    intend to give anything.

-   People to whom you intend to leave something, such as a favourite
    niece or close friend, may not get anything.

Therefore, if you wish to provide especially for your family members,
friends or a charity after your death, you should make a Will.

In addition, you cannot choose the people who will look after your
estate if you do not make a Will.

If you die intestate, the people who are appointed to look after your
estate are called “Administrators” instead of Executors although they
will have the same responsibilities. They have to apply to Court for
“Letters of Administration” instead of the Grant of Probate. The
procedure is generally more complicated and lengthy. For example, the
Administrators will have to provide two guarantors unless they get
approval from the Court to not have those guarantors.

**ADMINISTERING THE ESTATE**

When you die another person will have to apply to the Court for the
authority to deal with your assets. The Court will issue a document
known as a Grant of Representation (“Grant”). It has the Court’s seal on
it. It authorises the person named in the Grant to administer your
estate in accordance with the law.

If you made a Will, your Executor (i.e. the person you appointed to
carry out your Will) will apply for the Grant, known as a Grant of
Probate. They must deal with your assets in accordance with the terms of
your Will.

If you died intestate (with no valid Will), the appointed Administrator
will apply for the Grant, and in this case it is known as a Grant of
Letters of Administration. They must deal with your state in accordance
with the rules of intestacy.

Applying for a Grant is a relatively straightforward process with the
help of a lawyer. The three main steps are:

1.  Making a formal application for a Grant to the Court by filing the
    > documents that the Court needs;

2.  Filing a Schedule of Assets; and

3.  Extracting the Grant from the Court.

The Court will only issue the Grant after it is satisfied that all
procedural requirements are met. However, the Executors can act even
before the Grant is issued. For example, the Executors may pay or
release debts and transfer property or assets.

With the Grant, the Administrator or Executor can then begin to
administer your estate. They can do things such as:

-   Open and manage a bank account in the name of your estate.

-   Approach your bank and close your accounts – the money in them goes
    into your estate.

-   Sell, transfer or otherwise deal with your shares and other movable
    properties.

-   Sell, transfer or otherwise deal with your immovable properties
    owned by you solely or as a tenant-in-common.

**INTESTATE SMALL ESTATES: PUBLIC TRUSTEE MAY ADMINISTER**

If you die intestate (without a Will) and the value of your estate is
less than $50,000, your family may approach the Public Trustee to
administer your estate. There doesn’t need to be a Grant of Letters of
Administration. The Public Trustee will charge a prescribed fee for this
service. You can ask the Public Trustee about their current fees for it.

Such an application can be made to the Public Trustee by completing
their online application form and submitting the documents listed in it.

The Public Trustee is unlikely to agree to administer your estate if:

-   Your estate is worth more than $50,000.

-   There are conflicting claims to your estate, or disputes between the
    people who might inherit from you.

-   Your estate has outstanding debts and liabilities.

-   You had shares in private companies (whether foreign or local).

-   You were partner or sole-proprietor in a firm or other business.

-   You were the sole lessee of a HDB flat and someone who will inherit
    from you is a minor.

-   There are pending lawsuits which involve you.

-   There are insurance policies where one of more people have been
    nominated as beneficiaries to death benefits.

-   There are trust bank accounts opened with a child.

-   There are commercial vehicles involved such as taxis.

**INHERITANCE (FAMILY PROVISION) ACT**

As highlighted above, one of the benefits of having a valid Will is the
right to choose the people to whom you want to give your assets – that
is, to choose your beneficiaries.

However, this right is subject to a law that applies if you die leaving
a Will that does not adequately provide for your dependant(s). They can
apply to Court for a reasonable provision of maintenance from your
estate even though they are not beneficiaries under your Will. The Court
has the power to order your estate to make payment to them, either as a
lump sum or on such terms that the Court deems fit.

A dependant is:

-   Your spouse;

-   Your unmarried daughter(s);

-   Your son who has not attained the age of 21 years; and

-   Your son or daughter who, by reason of some mental or physical
    disability, is incapable of managing themselves.

**30 Advance Medical Directive**

**What is an Advance Medical Directive (AMD)?**

An Advance Medical Directive (AMD) is a legal document that you sign in
advance to tell your doctor that you don’t want any extraordinary
life-sustaining treatment to prolong your life if you are terminally
ill, unconscious and will die soon. Being “terminally ill” means that
you have no reasonable prospect of recovery, even temporary recovery.
“Life-sustaining treatment” is things such as artificial mechanical
ventilation where you continue to get pain medication, food and water.

Before your doctor can follow your instructions in your AMD, your doctor
and two others must all agree and certify that you are terminally ill.
Two of the three doctors must be specialists. If they can’t all agree,
the Ministry of Health will appoint three other specialists to review
your case. If they can’t all certify that you are terminally ill, your
doctor can’t obey your instructions in your AMD.

***How you make an AMD***

To make an AMD you have to be at least 21 years old. You also have to be
mentally fit. No one can make an AMD for another person, even if he/she
is a child or an adult mentally incapable of making an AMD on his/her
own.

To make an AMD, you need to complete an AMD form. You sign it with two
witnesses also signing. One of the witnesses must be a doctor. The other
one has to be someone who is at least 21 years old – sometimes, for
convenience, it’s a nurse who works for the doctor. It can be anyone who
doesn’t have an interest in your death, for example, they cannot be a
beneficiary under your will, insurance or CPF. The witnesses also have
to be people who don’t have any objections to an AMD, such as for
ethical or moral reasons.

Both witnesses must be present together to watch you sign the AMD form.
The doctor will ask you various questions because he/she has to make
sure that:

-   You are not being forced into making the AMD (such as by a family
    member) – this is because AMDs are entirely voluntary.

-   You are mentally fit.

-   You understand the nature and consequences of making an AMD – in
    other words, that you understand what an AMD is and how it works.

After you complete the AMD form, you must return it to the Registrar of
AMDs at the Ministry of Health because it has to be registered to make
it official. They send you an acknowledgement when the registration has
been done.

You can get an AMD Form from most polyclinics and hospitals. You can
also get them online from the Ministry of Health website at
<http://www.moh.gov.sg>.

***Cancelling an AMD***

There are three ways that you can revoke – which means cancel – your
AMD:

1.  By saying to at least one person who is at least 21 years of age
    > that you want to cancel it – or, if you can’t speak, but can
    > communicate in some other way, by communicating to at least one
    > such person in that way – and then that person tells the Registrar
    > of AMDs.

2.  By filling out and signing an official Revocation Form with at least
    > one witness over 21 years of age watching you sign it and then
    > also signing it – then you send the Revocation Form to the
    > Registrar of AMDs (or get someone else to send it for you).

3.  By writing to the Registrar of AMDs to say that you want to revoke
    > your AMD.

**31 Lasting Power of Attorney**

***What is a Lasting Power of Attorney (“LPA”) for and why should I have
one?***

A Lasting Power of Attorney (“LPA”) is a document that people use to
arrange for someone else to make decisions on their behalf when they can
no longer make decisions themselves. This might be permanent (such as
where the person develops dementia). Or it might be temporary (such as
where they are injured in an accident and go into a coma).

The decisions can be about property and other affairs, such as finances.
They can also be about personal welfare, which includes healthcare
decisions. This doesn’t include decisions about things like keeping
someone on life support; that comes under Advance Medical Directives,
please see Chapter 30 for more information.

Example 1. Mary is a member of the “Pioneer Generation”. She is worried
about signs of memory loss. Mary signs an LPA so that her daughter Jane
can make decisions on her behalf if she stops being able to make
decisions due to her dementia. With Mary’s LPA, Jane would have access
to Mary’s bank account and she would be able to use Mary’s money to pay
her medical expenses or her daily living expenses. Jane could also
decide where Mary will live and what care is provided to her.

Example 2. John and Mark have been good friends since they were at
school together. They did NS together too. Now in their mid-30s, John
has a wife and family. Mark is an adventurer and sportsman. Mark is
worried about who could make decisions for him if he is injured and goes
into a coma. Mark signs an LPA so that John can make decisions for Mark
if he temporarily (or even permanently) can’t make them himself.

The person who signs the LPA – Mary and Mark in the above examples – is
called the Donor of the LPA.

The person they appoint to make decisions for them – Jane and John in
the above examples – is called the Donee (pronounced “doh-nee”).

***Can I sign an LPA to appoint someone to make decisions for me?***

Yes, if you are:

-   At least 21 years of old; and

-   Capable of making decisions for yourself.

***Who can I appoint as my Donee? ***

You can choose who you want to appoint as your Donee. If you don’t have
an LPA, a Court could decide who to appoint to make decisions for you.
The disadvantage is that it might not be the person you would have
chosen. There is no maximum number of Donees that you can appoint. But
with multiple Donees, it gets complicated if they can’t agree on what to
decide.

The Donee needs to be someone you trust. They also need to be reliable
and competent enough to make decisions for you. They must sign a
statement in the LPA document to consent to being appointed. In other
words, you can’t appoint a Donee without them knowing about it and
agreeing to be appointed to make decisions for you.

There are different degrees of LPA. You can choose to give your Donee
general powers for all your personal welfare, property and affairs, or
you can specify exactly what areas that you would like him/her to have
the power to make decisions for you in case you cannot make them
yourself.

If you want to appoint a Donee only to make decisions about your
personal welfare, they must be at least 21 years old when you sign the
LPA. You can’t appoint a company or business to make personal welfare
decisions for you.

If you want to appoint a Donee to make decisions about your property and
affairs you can appoint:

-   An individual who:

-   Is at least 21 years old when you sign the LPA, and

-   Is not an undischarged bankrupt.

-   A licensed trust company.

***What are the Donee’s duties? ***

Your Donee must:

-   Act in your best interests;

-   Have regard for the guidance in the Code of Practice for Donees,
    including following the statutory principles – you can get this Code
    at
    <https://www.publicguardian.gov.sg/opg/Documents/CSC.MSF.OPGWebsite/Documents/CodeOfPractice.pdf>
    or by calling the Office of the Public Guardian;

-   Carry out your instructions and make decisions within the scope of
    the LPA;

-   Carry out their duties with reasonable care and skill;

-   Not take advantage of their position to benefit themselves, but
    always act to your benefit; and

-   Keep accounts of what is spent and done.

***What are the Donee’s powers? ***

As mentioned above, the decisions your Donee can make for you can be
about property and other affairs, such as finances and how your assets
are to be managed while you are alive. They can also be about personal
welfare, which includes healthcare decisions and other things such as
where you are to live.

You can choose to give your Donee:

-   General powers for all your personal welfare and/or all your
    property and affairs; or

-   Only specific powers as indicated in your LPA

Examples

Mary gives Jane, her Donee, the power to deal with property & affairs
relating to her financial matters such as managing her bank account and
property. This is an example of a general power.

Mark gives John, his Donee, the power to dispose of his public listed
shares in his Central Depository account. This is an example of a
specific power.

There are two versions of LPA documents available. Which one you use
depends on whether you give your Donee very wide powers (LPA Form 1) or
more restricted or special powers (LPA Form 2). You can get these forms
from <https://www.publicguardian.gov.sg/opg/Pages/Forms.aspx> or you can
call the Office of the Public Guardian to get them.

-   <span class="underline">LPA Form 1</span>: If you look at this
    you’ll see that it is mostly checkboxes for you to grant general
    powers to your Donee(s). It gives you the option of selecting basic
    conditions or restricting the powers. You don’t have to get a lawyer
    if you use LPA Form 1, though it’s often a good idea to get some
    legal help.

-   <span class="underline">LPA Form 2</span>: If you look at this
    you’ll see that it’s mostly blank spaces that need to be filled in
    with the specific powers that you want to give to your Donee(s).
    You’ll have to get a lawyer to help you.

Your Donee(s) can only make decisions on your behalf if you lack mental
capacity to make them, or if they reasonably believe that you lack it.

***Is the LPA permanent? Can it be cancelled / revoked? ***

-   If you get your mental capacity back, the Donee should step aside to
    allow you to manage your own affairs again. The LPA is still valid
    if you lose your mental capacity again.

-   If you want to, you can revoke (cancel) your LPA by completing a
    revocation form that you can get from
    <https://www.publicguardian.gov.sg/opg/Pages/Forms.aspx> or by
    calling the Office of the Public Guardian. You must also notify your
    Donee(s).

-   An LPA is cancelled or the Donee’s appointment is terminated if:

    -   You or your Donee dies.

    -   Your Donee lacks mental capacity to act as a Donee.

    -   Your Donee does not agree to being appointed as a Donee.

    -   Your Donee is your spouse when you sign the LPA and you are
        later divorced. This doesn’t apply if your LPA says specifically
        that your spouse continues to be your Donee after you are
        divorced.

    -   You or your Donee becomes a bankrupt.

    -   Where your Donee is a licensed trust company, if it is
        liquidated, wound up, dissolved or put under judicial
        management.

    -   A Court makes an order to cancel either the LPA or your Donee’s
        powers under it. This can happen if your Donee has not acted in
        your best interest.

***How do I make a LPA?***

You will need to do the following:

1.  Complete the LPA (LPA Form 1 or LPA Form 2).

2.  Bring the LPA form to a “certificate issuer” – this is:

-   A practising lawyer

-   A psychiatrist, or

-   An accredited medical practitioner

> (You can find a link to them on
> https://www.publicguardian.gov.sg/opg/Pages/Home.aspx.)
>
> The certificate issuer will sign on the LPA Form as a witness for you.
> They will need to certify that:

-   You understand the purpose of the LPA and the scope of the authority
    conferred under it;

-   That there is no duress or undue pressure used to induce you to
    create the LPA; and

-   There is nothing else that would prevent you from giving an LPA.

> If you are using LPA Form 2, you will need a lawyer’s help with the
> Annex to Part 3 of your LPA.

1.  Complete the LPA Application Form.

2.  Submit the following completed documents to the Office of the Public
    Guardian by post:

-   Completed LPA Form

-   Completed Application Form

-   Clear photocopies of your NRIC (front & back of NRIC) and also the
    NRIC of your done(s) and any replacement donee(s)

The next step is that the Office of the Public Guardian will verify your
LPA Form and Application to ensure the application can be accepted.
Next, there will be a mandatory six weeks waiting period. Then your LPA
will be registered (unless someone raises any valid objection to it).

***Fees***

At present, there is no fee for Singapore Citizens using LPA Form 1. It
costs $200 to register LPA Form 2. Singapore Permanent Residents and
Foreigners can find out the fees payable from the Office of the Public
Guardian.

***What if I have not made a LPA?***

If you have lost mental capacity and you have not registered a valid
LPA, under the Mental Capacity Act, a person can apply to Court to be
appointed to act on your behalf. They will be called your Deputy. They
can make decisions about your personal welfare, property and affairs,
subject to any restrictions imposed by the Court. Unlike a LPA, you will
not be able to nominate the person that you want to be your Deputy, and
you run the risk that the Court will appoint someone who you did not
want to make decisions for you. In addition, the costs incurred in
getting a Deputy appointed can be quite burdensome.

More information on the LPA is available at the website of the Office of
the Public Guardian at: *http://www.publicguardian.gov.sg/*

**32 Muslim Inheritance Laws, Estate Administration and Estate
Planning**

This chapter gives a broad overview of Muslim inheritance and estate
matters based on the Shafi’i school of Sunni jurisprudence.

In Singapore, the estate of a deceased Muslim must be distributed in
accordance with Islamic inheritance laws. The overarching Islamic
principle is that the estate distribution should be achieved in a manner
that is fair and just. The estate of the deceased must be properly
administered and accounted for. Careful and effective estate planning,
achieved in a manner that is fair and just, can overcome certain
limitations of Islamic intestate (dying without a valid will)
inheritance laws.

**MUSLIM INHERITANCE LAWS **

1.  <span class="underline">Sources of Muslim inheritance laws </span>

These are primarily:

1.  Syariah (Islamic law), including the law on Muslim Wills;

2.  *Faraid*, which governs intestate succession whether in whole or in
    part; and

3.  *Fatwas* by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (“MUIS”), the Islamic
    Religious Council of Singapore;

4.  Statutory laws, including:

    -   Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap 3 of Singapore Statutes)
        (“AMLA”): (i) Muslim Wills and insurance nominations must be in
        accordance with Syariah laws of the school of Muslim law
        professed by him; (ii) the intestate estate of Muslims shall be
        distributed according to Muslim law;

    -   Section 26 of CPF Act (Cap 36): Central Provident Fund (“CPF”)
        funds of a person who has made a nomination(s) shall not form
        part of the estate of the deceased person;

    -   Section 73 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61):
        life policy for the benefit of family shall not form part of the
        estate of the life insured;

    -   Section 49L of the Insurance Act (Cap 142): policy moneys
        subject to trust created under this section shall not form part
        of the estate of the policy owner. (Note: Presently, under AMLA,
        revocable insurance nomination under section 49M(2) forms part
        of the estate. However, MUIS has issued a *fatwa* in 2012
        stating, *inter alia*, that revocable insurance nomination is a
        valid form of *hibah* (gift) and does not form part of the
        estate of the policy owner).

5.  Civil law, including common law principles of joint-tenancy
    (property held in joint tenancy is subject to right of survivorship
    of joint owner and may not form part of the estate of the deceased
    joint owner).

1.  <span class="underline">How property passes after death </span>

> Generally, a Muslim estate will be distributed in accordance with
> *faraid*, which is described as “that section of the Islamic law that
> deals with the distribution of the estate of a deceased person among
> his heirs in accordance with Allah’s decree in the Holy Quran and
> according to the hadith or tradition of the Messenger’s Allah
> (S.A.W.)” – see
> http://www.muis.gov.sg/cms/services/Inheritance.aspx?id=9342 for
> further explanation.
>
> If there is a Will, up to one-third of the estate shall be distributed
> in accordance with the Will and the remainder shall be distributed in
> accordance with *faraid* (more details in the later part of this
> Chapter). A Muslim may also transfer his assets during his lifetime by
> way of existing provisions within the civil law framework such as CPF
> or insurance nominations or by way of instruments recognised by Muslim
> law such as the *nazaar* (vow) or *hibah ruqba*. In all cases, those
> who are entitled to the estate may agree to give up all or any part of
> their share to others they wish to benefit: you are always free to
> give away what is yours. It is also permissible for the inheritance to
> be divided equally if all are agreeable.

1.  <span class="underline">Muslim Wills (“*Wasiyyah*”) </span>

> A Muslim Will must conform to Syariah law in form and content. Not
> more than one third of the net estate can be willed away to ensure
> enough is left for *faraid* heirs who are dependants (parents, spouse,
> children). Where the deceased left a Will to give away 1/3 of the
> estate, the remaining 2/3 of the estate will be distributed according
> to the *faraid*.
>
> Heirs who will inherit under *faraid* cannot be beneficiaries under
> the Will to ensure shares as among themselves are not enlarged beyond
> what is stipulated under Syariah. This is to avoid discontent and
> disharmony among family members. A charity can be a beneficiary under
> a Muslim Will provided the charity exists for purposes permissible
> under Syariah otherwise it is invalid.
>
> The testator can name the Executor of his estate in his Will. The
> testator may also, in his Will, appoint a guardian for his minor
> children. He may appoint a trustee, who need not be a Muslim, to
> manage his children’s inheritance while they are minors.
>
> There must be two male witnesses to the Will, but two females can be
> substituted for one male. Witnesses cannot be beneficiaries to the
> Will. A Will is invalid if it is written by a minor, written under
> duress, or by a person without the proper mental capacity.

1.  *<span class="underline">Faraid </span>*

> *Faraid*, the Muslim law on intestate succession, seeks to effect an
> equitable distribution of the estate in a fair and just manner that is
> likely to maintain family harmony. For instance, males get two shares
> for every share given to his female counterpart because males are
> expected to assume financial responsibility for the women.
>
> Female heirs are always entitled to a portion of the estate,
> regardless how small, while males who are residuary heirs may take all
> (if there are none with prior rights) or nothing (if those with fixed
> shares and prior rights exhaust the estate).
>
> *Faraid* determines with certainty:

-   The persons who are entitled to benefit (“*Waris*” or the lawful
    heirs);

-   The precise shares of each beneficiary (these may be “fixed” shares,
    being a pre-determined part of the net estate, or it may be a
    “variable” share, being a pre-determined portion of the residuary
    estate after distribution of fixed shares);

-   Precise mathematical adjustments to shares to avoid incongruities or
    to achieve fairness such as:

    -   Proportional reduction of each share (“*aul*”) where fractional
        shares awarded exceed the whole;

    -   Proportional appreciation of each share (“*radd*”) where the
        estate is not exhausted by fixed share heirs;

    -   Between husband and wife who are lawful heirs, where the
        hus­band gets less than his wife, their shares are pooled and
        re-adjust­ed such that the husband gets double his wife’s
        entitlement. The rationale is to avoid discord in marital
        relations, and to emphasise the trust placed on male relations
        in their financial responsibility over females;

-   The ultimate residuary beneficiary, which is “*Baitulmal*” (Muslim
    community fund administered and managed by MUIS), if any part of the
    intestate estate is unclaimed by lawful heirs. This ensures finality
    to the process of estate administration.

**ESTATE ADMINISTRATION **

This is a brief outline of estate administration:

1.  <span class="underline">Determine what assets belong to the estate
    </span>

-   CPF Monies / Insurance Nominations

-   MUIS *fatwas* acknowledge that CPF nominations and insurance
    > nominations are new forms of *hibah* or permissible gifts by the
    > deceased. Thus, if the deceased has nominated beneficiaries of his
    > CPF account or insurance policies, these will not form part of the
    > estate and the nominees are entitled to the monies in full for
    > their own use.

-   Property held as Joint Tenants

-   If the deceased held property as a joint tenant, the survivor takes
    > all, and the property does not fall into the deceased’s estate.

-   If husband and wife are Malays, each may be entitled to share in
    > matrimonial property (*harta sepencarian*), and on the demise of
    > either, the survivor may claim half of the matrimonial property in
    > his own name, and the remainder falls into the deceased’s estate
    > where it is shared among *faraid* heirs.

1.  <span class="underline">Determine the liabilities of the estate
    </span>

-   Apart from obvious liabilities such as debts owed by the deceased,
    other liabilities of the estate include medical, funeral and
    testamentary expenses.

1.  <span class="underline">Determine the list of potential
    beneficiaries </span>

-   Find out if there is a Will and, if so, who the beneficiaries under
    the Will are. If Will beneficiaries are also *faraid* heirs, first
    resolve the conflict as to entitlement.

-   Determine the surviving *faraid* heirs. If a *faraid* heir dies
    before distribution of the deceased’s estate, their shares go to
    their own estates and do not fall back into the original estate.

1.  <span class="underline">Obtain the Certificate of Inheritance
    (*Sijil Warisan*) </span>

-   Application is made online to the Syariah Court for a Certification
    of Inheritance (“*Sijil Warisan*”). A fee is chargeable, currently
    $46.

-   The applicant must identify the deceased, the beneficiaries, state
    the relationship of beneficiaries to deceased, and make a Statutory
    Declaration that the information given is correct.

-   The system automatically computes the shares of the heirs, and the
    Certificate states the names of each heir and their precise share.

1.  <span class="underline">Apply to Court for Letters of Administration
    or Grant of Probate </span>

-   If the deceased died intestate, any beneficiary can apply for
    > Letters of Administration to appoint an authorised person to deal
    > with the estate, provided that person(s) with prior rights have
    > renounced the rights to apply for Letters of Administration. That
    > authorized person is known as the Administrator.

-   If an Executor is appointed in the deceased’s Will, the Executor
    > applies for a Grant of Probate. You may need to work with a lawyer
    > to make the application.

1.  <span class="underline">Dealing with estate and distribution </span>

-   The Administrator or Executor has the authority to deal with the
    estate.

-   He/she must pay off the debts of the deceased and other estate
    liabilities.

-   If there are beneficiaries under a Will, the net estate (up to
    one-third) is distributed to them, then the remainder is distributed
    to *faraid* heirs according to the shares specified in the
    Certificate of Inheritance.

1.  <span class="underline">Accounting to beneficiaries </span>

-   Finally, the administrator or executor must account to the
    > beneficiaries for their dealing with the estate until such time
    > that their duties are completed.

-   If any beneficiary is dissatisfied with any aspect of estate
    > administration, he/she may seek legal redress.

**ESTATE PLANNING **

Bearing in mind the overarching Syariah principle of just and fair
distribution to your dependants, here are some estate planning tools and
strategies that you may wish to consider.

1.  Hold property as a joint tenant with your intended beneficiary.

2.  Open a joint bank account with your intended beneficiary.

3.  Nominate your intended beneficiary to your CPF monies or your life
    insurance policy.

4.  Make a gift to your intended beneficiary during your lifetime.

5.  Execute a *hibah al-ruqba* instrument to make a gift to a Donee on
    the condition that the Donee survives the Donor, failing which the
    gift reverts back to the Donor. *Hibah al-ruqba* has been likened to
    a joint tenancy as the survivor takes all.

6.  Execute a *nazar* (vow) instrument of conditional transfer. *Nazar*
    must comply with religious requirements including but not limited to
    correct intention and non-abuse. A *nazar* whose purpose is to
    defeat the entitlement of a lawful heir may fail the test for
    religious compliance. In addition, if the *nazar* works as a
    testamentary disposition, it is subject to the one-third limit for
    Muslim Wills.

7.  Create a trust for intended beneficiaries or charities.

**CONCLUSION **

These are the main issues that you are likely to be confronted with on
Muslim estate matters. You should consult the appropriate professional
advisers especially if you face complex circumstances.

**PART VII TRANSACTIONAL MATTERS**

**33 Buying and Selling a House**

**PURCHASING A HOUSE OR FLAT **

When buying a house (“House”) or a flat (“Flat”), you should seek advice
from your lawyer on the following:

***Types of residential properties ***

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>“Landed property”:</td>
<td>Properties that are built on land lots by which a single title is given to the owner of both the land and the building on the land, e.g. bungalows, semi-detached houses, terrace houses.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>“Condominiums”:</td>
<td>Private residential buildings which are subdivided in title into various strata title lots, each of which is owned by different owners.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>“HDB”:</td>
<td>Public residential housing built by the Housing and Development Board.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

***Title ***

The title to the House and the Flat may be:

-   Freehold, i.e. an absolute title and you own the property forever;

-   An estate in perpetuity, i.e. an estate is forever subject to the
    payment of a quit rent (i.e. an annual rent for ;

-   Leasehold, i.e. a lease for 99 years or 999 years. At the end of the
    leasehold, you no longer own the House or Flat and the property will
    have to be surrendered to the government; and

-   Certain properties where the title may still be under the common law
    lease (under the old conveyancing system) for 99 years or 999 years
    with no interest in the land or with a proportionate fractional
    share in the land subject to the lease.

***Area of House or Flat ***

You are advised to check the land area of the House/floor area of the
Flat with your lawyer. You may also want to consult a qualified surveyor
if you suspect any inconsistency in the boundary line, if you think your
land is being infringed upon, or if you require the actual area of the
House or Flat.

***Financing ***

Before you decide to purchase a House or Flat you should ensure that you
have sufficient funds available to complete the purchase. If you are
financing your purchase with your Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) funds
and/or a loan, you should contact the CPF Board and the lender
bank/finance company in advance to sign all relevant application forms
and furnish all relevant information and documents. This is to ensure
that the CPF funds and/or loan will be approved and the funds will be
available.

You should contact the CPF Board and enquire on your eligibility for
bank financing as early as possible, preferably before you pay the
upfront deposit. In addition to the purchase price, you will have to
make provision for the stamp duty, lawyer’s fees, disbursements (costs),
property tax, maintenance funds, and loan processing fees, etc. You can
request your lawyer to give you an estimate of such amounts that will be
incurred by the purchase, as well as the relevant CPF charge and
mortgage.

Buyer’s stamp duty will have to be paid in advance under the recent
amendments to the law. Visit the IRAS website below for further details
on stamp duty:

<https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Other-Taxes/Stamp-Duty-for-Property/>

***Property agents ***

Property agents (or salespersons) are required to be registered with a
statutory board called the Council for Estate Agencies. You are able to
check a public registry of estate agencies and agents to check the
legitimacy of the agency or agent that you are considering engaging.
This can be found at the Council of Estate Agencies website:
<http://www.cea.gov.sg/cea/app/newimplpublicregister/publicregister.jspa>

The Register will display the name, photograph, licence/registration
number, the company that the agent is working for, registration validity
period and records of offences committed or disciplinary actions taken,
if any.

**MANNER OF OWNERSHIP **

If you are buying the property with one or more persons, you have to
choose the manner of ownership:

1.  <span class="underline">Joint tenants </span>

> Joint tenants hold the property equally. If A and B are joint tenants,
> then upon the death of A, A’s interest in the property will
> automatically revert to B. Even if A had left a Will, A’s interest in
> the property will not be distributed in accordance with A’s Will. The
> right, title and interest of A in that property passes to B,
> irrespective of any direction to the contrary in the Will of A or the
> intestacy rules. In other words, the survivor of the two will be
> entitled to the entire property. This is called the right of
> survivorship.

1.  <span class="underline">Tenants-in-common in equal (or other
    specified) shares </span>

> Tenants-in-common may hold the property in equal shares or in other
> proportions of shares (i.e. one-third/two thirds or
> one-quarter/three-quarters). If A and B are tenants-in-common, on the
> death of A, the right, title and interest of A passes to his estate to
> be distributed according to his Will or according to the intestacy
> rules under the Intestate Succession Act if he has no Will.

**RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY ACT **

Only Singapore citizens and approved persons can purchase landed
“residential property” as defined in the Residential Properties Act.
Foreigners are eligible to purchase units in condominiums or apartments
that are not landed dwelling houses. Foreigners who wish to purchase
landed property in Singapore must first seek the approval of the
Controller of Residential Property. In general, the application for
approval will be considered favourably if the foreigner is a permanent
resident who is of economic benefit to Singapore, and who possesses
professional qualifications that are of value or benefit to Singapore.

**YOUR LAWYER’S ROLE IN A PROPERTY PURCHASE **

When you purchase property, your lawyer’s responsibilities are to:

1.  Review the terms and conditions of the contract to ensure that your
    interest is protected and explain these terms and conditions to you.

2.  Conduct searches on the title of the property to ensure that you
    will be given proper title to the property that is identified in the
    contract and which you have negotiated to buy.

3.  Send routine queries to various government departments to ensure
    that there are no adverse regulatory notices or government schemes
    that will affect the property you wish to purchase.

4.  Pending completion of your purchase, your lawyer will lodge a caveat
    against the title to the property – this serves to notify the public
    (and any third party interested in the property) that you have a
    valid interest or claim to the title of the property arising from
    the contract for the sale and purchase or the option to purchase.

5.  If you are using a bank loan to finance this purchase, your lawyer
    will also liaise with the bank’s lawyer who is responsible for
    preparing the mortgage to secure the loan. In some cases, your bank
    will also appoint the same lawyer to represent its interest.

6.  Your lawyer will be responsible for liaising with the bank and the
    CPF Board (or their lawyers) to ensure that your housing loan and
    your CPF funds are in place and ready for drawdown in order to
    complete the purchase within the agreed completion period.

7.  Complete the Sale – this is a technical term referring to the
    payment of the contracted sale price (from you as the buyer) in
    exchange for the signed conveyance of title called the “Instrument
    of Transfer” which effectively transfers the ownership of the
    property from the current owner(s) to yourself (as the new owner).

**PROCEDURES FOR PURCHASE **

Generally, legal contracts for the sale and purchase of property take
two forms:

1.  An Option to Purchase; or

2.  A Sale and Purchase Agreement.

An Option or Agreement/contract for the purchase of a House or Flat can
be formed in many ways, e.g.:

1.  By correspondence;

2.  By the exercise of an Option; or

3.  By the parties signing an Agreement/contract, which are often
    prepared by brokers. Such documents create legal rights and
    obligations, dealing particularly with:

-   The title of the property;

-   The mode of payment;

-   The discharge of encumbrances;

-   Schemes and other matters affecting the property, e.g. road
    > widening;

-   Whether the property will be transferred with vacant possession or
    > subject to tenancy;

-   The date of completion;

-   The consequences of a delay in completion; and

-   Other special terms.

In general, in a contract for the sale and purchase of property, there
must be certainty as to the parties, the property as well as the price
(otherwise known as “the three Ps”). Such sale agreements must be in
writing (or be the subject of a memorandum or note in writing) and
signed by the party to be charged in order to be enforceable. You are
advised to consult your lawyer immediately after paying the booking fee
and obtaining the prescribed Option to Purchase the property. The lawyer
will then investigate the title and advise you on the terms of the
prescribed Agreement before you accept it and exercise the Option to
Purchase.

**THE LAW SOCIETY’S CONDITIONS OF SALE **

Most contracts for the sale and purchase of property in Singapore will
incorporate standard terms called the Singapore Law Society’s Conditions
of Sale 1999 or the more recent Singapore Law Society’s Conditions of
Sale 2012. If the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement or of the
Option are silent on certain points, then the provisions of these
conditions will apply. These conditions may also be modified by express
terms in the contract: for example, it is common for the sale to be
subject to the property being unaffected by road widening schemes.

**PURCHASE FROM AN UNLICENSED HOUSING DEVELOPER **

If you wish to purchase from an unlicensed housing developer, you are
advised to consult your lawyer before paying the booking fee, as
unlicensed developers are not required to comply with the rules of the
Housing Developers (Licensing and Control) Act. The unlicensed developer
is free to mortgage the land and there are no statutory safeguards to
ensure that the progress payments from the purchaser would be utilised
to pay off the mortgage loan. In the event the unlicensed developer
defaults in his/her mortgage payments or faces financial difficulties,
he/she may not be able to complete the development. Further, you may
have difficulty obtaining approval to use your CPF funds to buy a
property or obtain a mortgage from a bank or finance company to finance
your purchase from an unlicensed housing developer in view of the risks
involved.

**LEGAL COSTS **

The lawyer’s fees do not include stamp duty or disbursements (costs)
properly incurred by the lawyer.

**SELLING YOUR HOUSE OR FLAT **

1.  <span class="underline">Option/Agreement </span>

You can sell your House or Flat by

-   Granting an Option to the purchaser; or

-   Entering into an Agreement/contract.

> Common terms that are found in an Option or an Agreement are described
> in more details above. You should consult your Lawyer before accepting
> or signing the Option or Agreement/contract. This is to ensure that
> your interests are protected.

1.  <span class="underline">Stakeholding </span>

> The vendor’s lawyers will normally hold the deposit on the exercise of
> the Option or the signing of the Agreement/contract as a stakeholder.
> This is because the sale will normally be subject to conditions such
> as:
>
> • The discharge of encumbrances like mortgage and CPF charge;
>
> • The title being in order; and
>
> • Satisfactory replies to legal requisitions to the various government
> departments.
>
> The deposit is therefore held by the vendor’s lawyers as stakeholders
> to assure the purchaser that the deposit will be kept safely until
> completion of the purchase.
>
> Where you are buying newly developed private residential properties,
> commercial properties and executive condominiums under certain
> statutory schemes, the Singapore Academy of Law will hold the
> instalment payments until the appropriate times for their payment out
> to the vendor.

1.  <span class="underline">Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) </span>

> At present, GST is not payable on residential property. However, as
> some residential properties (e.g. a shop house with a Flat above) may
> involve the supply of movable furniture and fittings and GST may be
> payable for those things. You should seek advice from your lawyer.

**YOUR LAWYER’S ROLE IN A PROPERTY SALE **

When you sell Property, your lawyer’s primary responsibility is to
ensure that on completion, you are ready to deliver the title to the
property free from your mortgage and CPF charge. This requires your
lawyer to liaise with your bank’s lawyer and the CPF Board’s lawyer for
payment (out of the sale proceeds) of the outstanding loan amount and
refund of your CPF funds sufficient to discharge the bank’s mortgage and
CPF charge.

**HDB FLATS **

You are advised to contact the HDB directly in respect of the sale
and/or purchase of HDB flats. The HDB has devised their own form of
Agreement/contract for the purchase of HDB flats.

**34 Intellectual Property Protection**

**WHAT IS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (“IP”)? **

Intellectual Property (“IP”) refers to creations of the human mind. Some
common examples of IP are inventions, product brands, films, and
computer software.

There are several types of IP. Each type covers different creations and
is governed by different laws in Singapore. You can read more about them
on the website of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (“IPOS”)
([www.ipos.gov.sg](http://www.ipos.gov.sg)). The types of IP that you
are likely to encounter in your day-to-day activities are <span
class="underline">trademarks, patents, registered designs, copyright,
and trade secrets</span>. These five types are explained in more detail
below.

Depending on the type of IP that you wish to protect, you may need to
register the IP with IPOS in order to obtain protection for the IP under
Singapore law.

The law gives you, as the IP owner, an <span class="underline">exclusive
right to use your IP</span>. IP is also considered a form of property
that you, as the owner, can licence, assign, or sell to third parties.

<span class="underline">IP protection is territorial</span>. This means
that an IP protected in Singapore may not enjoy the same recognition or
protection overseas. If you wish to obtain overseas protection for your
IP, you may need to register your IP separately in those countries.

The recourses (solutions) that you can seek in an action for use of your
IP without your consent include:

-   An injunction to stop the infringing action;

-   Damages for the loss suffered; and/or

-   The profits gained by the infringing party at your own expense.

**WHAT IS A TRADE MARK? **

A trade mark is a sign which is used by a trader to distinguish its
goods and services from those of other traders. It can be represented
graphically in the form of your company’s name or logo. The following
can generally not be registered as trade marks: descriptive marks (e.g.
cheap and delicious); indistinct marks or marks common in an industry;
offensive, immoral or deceptive marks; marks identical to earlier marks;
or marks that could cause confusion or which are similar to well-known
marks.

Registering your trade mark with IPOS gives you an exclusive right under
the Trade Marks Act to use your trade mark, and prevents others from
using signs which are identical or similar to your own registered trade
mark.

To register a trade mark, you will need to provide: (i) a distinctive
sign which you wish to use as a trade mark; and (ii) a description of
the goods and services on which the trade mark would be used.

Registered trade marks are valid for ten years from the date of filing.
You can make your registered trade mark last indefinitely by renewing it
at the end of every ten years.

There are two symbols which you can use to indicate that your sign is a
trade mark:

-   The ® symbol, if your trade mark has been successfully registered.

-   The ™ symbol, if your trade mark has not been registered, which
    denotes that the mark is being used as a trade mark.

**WHAT IS A PATENT? **

A patent is a monopoly right granted to an owner of an invention to use
and exploit its invention.

Registering your invention with IPOS gives you an exclusive right under
the Patents Act to use the invention, and prevents others from making,
selling and using your invention.

You should consider the following issues before applying for a patent:

-   Is my invention patentable? Your invention must satisfy three
    criteria:

    1.  It must be new and never before publicly disclosed, anywhere in
        the world;

    2.  It must contain an improvement over existing technology and
        cannot be obvious to someone who is skilled in that field of
        that invention;

    3.  It should be useful and have some form of practical application
        in the industry.

-   Do I own the invention? The rule of thumb is that an invention
    belongs to the inventor, unless the inventor developed it in the
    course of employment, in which case, it belongs to the employer.

-   How do I prepare a patent application? The patent application and
    accompanying patent specification(s) need to fulfil certain legal
    and technical criteria. You may wish to engage a lawyer or a
    registered patent agent to help you with your patent application.

Once granted, a patent is valid for 20 years from the date of filing,
subject to payment of an annual renewal fee. Thereafter, the patent is
to be maintained yearly, starting from the 5<sup>th</sup> year.

**WHAT IS A REGISTERED DESIGN? **

The Registered Designs Act allows a designer to register and protect the
external look or appearance of a product (e.g. its shape, configuration
or pattern), which the designer intends to manufacture. Some examples of
product designs that have been registered under the Registered Designs
Act are those for furniture, bags and cameras.

Registering a product design with IPOS gives you an exclusive right
under the Registered Designs Act to the overall look of the whole or
part of your product design. The right enables you to stop others from
making and dealing with products incorporating the registered design
without your permission. You can use your registration to protect your
market share by barring copying by others, and it also allows you to
make money by licencing your design to third parties for commercial
returns or by selling the design for monetary returns.

You should consider the following issues before applying to register a
product design:

-   Does my product design satisfy registration criteria? Your product
    design must satisfy two criteria:

1.  It must be new and must not have been registered or published in
    Singapore or elsewhere before; and

2.  It must be industrially applied to an article (i.e. more than 50
    copies of the article have been or are intended to be produced for
    sale or hire).

-   Do I own the product design? The rule of thumb is that a product
    design belongs to the designer, unless the designer created it in
    the course of employment (in which case, the employer owns the
    product design), or if the product design was commissioned (in which
    case, the person commissioning the design owns the product design).

Once granted, a registered design is valid for an initial period of five
years from the date of filing the registration, and can be renewed every
five years up to a maximum of 15 years.

**WHAT IS COPYRIGHT? **

Copyright protects the rights of creators in their works. The various
kinds of works that are protected by copyright include literary works,
artistic works, dramatic works, musical works, films, television and
broadcasts.

Unlike trade marks and patents, you do not have to register your work in
order to obtain copyright protection in Singapore. Protection under the
Copyright Act arises automatically if:

1.  Your work is an original work;

2.  Your work has been expressed in tangible form (i.e. recorded or put
    down in writing); and

3.  You, as author/creator of the work, were a Singapore citizen or
    resident in Singapore (if you were not, your work still qualifies
    for protection if first publication of your work took place in
    Singapore).

The general rule is that the author/creator owns the copyright in work
created, unless the author/creator created the work the in course of
employment (in which case, the employer owns the copyright), or if the
work was commissioned (in which case, the commissioner owns the
copyright).

As copyright owner, you enjoy exclusivity to a bundle of rights that
live in your work. The bundle of rights and duration of copyright
protection varies depending on the type of work and whether it has been
published. For instance, in the case of literary work:

-   The bundle of rights comprise:

    1.  The right to reproduce the work;

    2.  The right to publish the work;

    3.  The right to perform the work in public;

    4.  The right to communicate the work to the public; and

    5.  The right to make an adaption of the work and to do any of the
        aforementioned acts in relation to the adaptation.

-   Protection of the work starts from the time of creation/publication,
    and lasts for the life of the author/creator and another 70 years
    from the end of the year in which the author/creator died.

It is not crucial to display the © symbol on your copyrighted work as it
simply functions as a notice of copyright and does not give you any
substantive or additional rights in the work. Failure to display the ©
symbol does not mean that you have waived your copyright in the work.

If you wish to use materials protected by copyright (e.g. photocopying a
book), you should bear in mind that consent is needed to do anything
that only the copyright owner has the exclusive right to do **<span
class="underline">unless</span>** it is a situation that falls under the
“fair dealing” exception or other exceptions to copyright infringement
which are set out in the Copyright Act.

**WHAT IS A TRADE SECRET? **

A trade secret is information or an idea that usually has commercial
value, is important to the business, and is not known to the public. A
trade secret is usually only disclosed to certain key individuals within
the business organisation. The leak of a trade secret may have harmful
consequences to the business.

Trade secrets are protected in Singapore by the law of confidentiality.
There is no requirement to register trade secrets. A trade secret can be
protected indefinitely, provided relevant measures are put in place to
safeguard the information and ensure that it is not leaked out.

The various measures that you can take to protect trade secrets are:

-   Establishing that the information is confidential.

-   Ensuring that the information is only disclosed to a limited number
    of people on a need-to-know basis.

-   Ensuring that anyone who is aware or has access to the information
    signs a Non- Disclosure Agreement. For employees, a confidentiality
    clause can be included in their employment contract. You may wish to
    consult with a lawyer on what should be included in the
    Non-Disclosure Agreement or employment contract.

The unauthorised disclosure of a trade secret may constitute a breach of
confidence for which you can take legal action in Court.

**35 Starting a Business**

Starting a business? Manage your business risks by making sure that you
establish a good foundation for a growing business.

**REGISTRATION **

The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) is the
relevant governing body responsible for registering and regulating
business entities in Singapore and its website
(<http://www.acra.gov.sg/>) should be the first stop for any person who
wishes to do business in Singapore.

Before carrying on a business, the law requires you to register your
business with ACRA. Which business structure you use will depend on your
business needs.

There are four main types of business structures. They are:

***1. Sole proprietorship ***

A sole proprietorship must only have one business owner. It is not a
separate legal entity. This means that as the business owner, you are
personally liable for all debts and losses of the business. All profits
of the business form part of your personal income and will be taxed at
the relevant rate of personal income tax.

***2. Partnership ***

A partnership must have at least two partners and like a sole
proprietorship, is not a separate legal entity. Each partner is
personally liable for the debts and losses of the partnership and
partnership profits form part of each partner’s personal income.

***3. Limited liability partnership ***

A limited liability partnership is a hybrid vehicle. It is a separate
legal entity and there will not be any recourse against the partners
personally. However, partnership profits are taxed in the hands of each
partner at the relevant rate of personal income tax.

***4. Private limited company/public company***

A company is a separate legal entity and in most cases, recourse is
limited to the assets of the company. A company’s profits are also taxed
in the hands of the company at corporate income tax rates. A company
must have at least one shareholder and one director who is ordinarily a
resident of Singapore.

For more information on the main differences between the business
structures and also how to register each business structure, please
visit ACRA’s website.

If you have an existing business overseas and are still evaluating
business opportunities in Singapore, you may also consider setting up a
representative office in Singapore. There are a number of restrictions
on the business activities of the representative office and further
information may be found on the website of the International Enterprises
Singapore: <https://roms.iesingapore.gov.sg/>.

**LICENCES **

The Online Business Licensing Services Portal
(<http://licence1.business.gov.sg>) provides information about the
licences required for any business. A new business owner only needs to
select his business activity and a list of licences and permits required
for that business activity would be shown to him.

**TAX **

The rate of tax and period of assessment will differ depending on the
type of business structure used.

Personal income tax is charged on a tiered basis and the rate currently
ranges from 0–22% depending on the amount of income earned. Each period
of assessment begins on 1 January and ends on 31 December.

Corporate income tax is chargeable at a flat rate of 17% and the period
of assessment depends on the company’s financial year. The Inland
Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) is the relevant governing body
and more information can be found at its website:
<http://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/default.aspx>.

**GST **

The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) is charged on any supply of goods or
services made in Singapore. The rate of GST is currently 7%. You will
not need to register your business for GST purposes unless the total
value of goods and services supplied exceeds or is expected to exceed $1
million. Further information on GST registration and how to administer
it may also be found on IRAS’ website.

**EMPLOYEES **

You may need to hire employees in the course of your business. Certain
minimum requirements are stipulated (required) by law, such as the
minimum number of days of paid leave and sick leave. You are required by
law to protect the safety and health of your employees. For further
information, kindly refer to the Ministry of Manpower’s website:
<http://www.mom.gov.sg/>.

Employers are also encouraged to adopt fair and merit-based employment
practices. Further information is available at the Tripartite Alliance
for Fair Employment Practices’ website: <http://www.tafep.sg/>

**CPF **

Employers must contribute to the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”), which
applies to employees who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents.
Employer contribution rates vary depending on the age of the employee
and the amount of wages earned.

Please refer to the CPF website for the relevant contribution rates:
<https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Employers/EmployerGuides#PayingCPFContributions>

**BUSINESS PREMISES **

In this modern business era, there are many options available to
business owners, besides office-based working.

To help reduce the cost of start-ups, the Singapore Government has
relaxed the rules on home offices.

Both Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flats and private homes can
now be used as home offices. HDB’s website at: <http://www.hdb.gov.sg/>
provides more detailed information on the HDB Home Office Scheme.

In addition, the Jurong Town Corporation (“JTC”) also has various
premises specially designed for start-ups. For more information, visit
JTC’s website at: <http://www.jtc.gov.sg/>.

**ASSISTANCE SCHEMES FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES **

The Singapore Government actively promotes entrepreneurship by giving
grants.

Assistance schemes also help local enterprises.

Any business owner requiring business advisory services can approach any
of the five Enterprise Development Centres managed by SPRING Singapore
(<http://www.spring.gov.sg>).

**BANK ACCOUNTS **

It is important for a business to establish a business bank account that
is separate from any personal accounts. Do speak to the various banks to
find out the services that best suit your needs.

**ACCOUNTING SYSTEM **

Without proper records, no business owner will know if he/she is making
or losing money. It is important for a start-up company to establish an
accounting system that can track expenses and income based on categories
that will continue to be relevant as the business evolves and grows.
Certain business structures are also required by law to maintain
accounting and other records. In certain circumstances, such records
must be lodged with ACRA. The IRAS Accounting Software Register
(<http://www.iras.gov.sg>) sets out the list of softwares that are
compliant with the requirements set out in the e-Tax Guide.

**NETWORKING **

One of the most common and cost efficient methods of promoting your
business and meeting others in your industry is to join a trade
association or the local Chamber of Commerce.

The key business associations in Singapore are:

-   Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (“ASME”); and

-   Singapore Business Federation (“SBF”).

The four local Chambers of Commerce in Singapore are:

-   Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (“SCCCI”);

-   Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce & Industry (“SMCCCI”);

-   Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (“SICCI”); and

-   Singapore International Chamber of Commerce & Industry (“SICC”).

**PART VIII ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

**<span class="underline">ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
(“ADR”)</span>**

**Alternative dispute resolution** (“**ADR”)** is a term used to
describe the processes and techniques that parties can use to settle
disputes without resorting to litigation in Court.

The three main ADR processes practiced in Singapore are mediation,
arbitration and neutral evaluation.

**<span class="underline">MEDIATION</span>**

**Mediation** is a process in which a mediator facilitates negotiations
between the disputing parties with the aim of arriving at a mutually
acceptable settlement. The mediator does not act as a judge and has no
power to make any decisions on the dispute or to force the parties to
agree. His role is to help the parties find a win-win solution. The
parties do not reach a resolution unless all sides agree.

Mediation is confidential and without prejudice. If there is subsequent
litigation, matters raised and discussed at mediation cannot be referred
to by any party. If the mediation is successful, the parties will enter
into a binding settlement agreement that reflects the terms of
settlement. If the mediation fails, the parties have to resort to Court
or other ADR processes to resolve their dispute.

**<span class="underline">ARBITRATION</span>**

**Arbitration** is a process where both parties agree to appoint another
person, the arbitrator, to adjudicate their dispute. Both parties will
present their arguments and evidence to the Arbitrator who will make a
binding decision based on the merits of the case. The Arbitrator’s
decision may be enforced as an order of court.

The Tribunal decides on the arbitration process, and there is no fixed
procedure that the Tribunal needs to follow. This provides flexibility
to the parties. For instance, the arbitration does not need to go
through a formal oral hearing (like a trial).

You can only go for arbitration if both parties have agreed to the
resolution of the dispute through this process. Parties normally agree
to arbitration by means of an arbitration clause in a contract made by
them before a dispute has arisen. As a matter of good practice, you
should check whether the contracts you enter into have such arbitration
clauses.

**<span class="underline">NEUTRAL EVALUATION</span>**

**Neutral Evaluation** is a process where the disputing parties seek an
opinion on the merits of their case from another person, namely an
evaluator. It is a voluntary process that takes place only if both
parties agree to it. After considering the parties’ case and evidence,
the evaluator will render a reasoned assessment on the possible outcome
of the dispute at trial. Parties may choose to accept the evaluator’s
assessment and if they do so, they are bound by it.

**<span class="underline">Factors To Consider When Choosing A Form Of
ADR </span>**

There is no form of ADR that is always the best. Parties must choose
which form to use according to their circumstances, needs and concerns.
More than one form of ADR may be used. For example, parties may start
with Neutral Evaluation and use the Evaluator’s assessment as a basis
for Mediation.

Some of the main factors to consider are as follows: -

-   **Costs and time.** Mediation generally takes a shorter time and is
    less costly than Arbitration or Neutral Evaluation.

-   **Nature and Complexity of the dispute.** Non-commercial and
    communal disputes may best be resolved by mediation at the Community
    Mediation Centre, while disputes involving very technical facts
    should ideally be referred to Neutral Evaluation or Arbitration by
    an expert in the field.

-   **Quantum of the dispute.** If the quantum (amount of money) in
    dispute is a relatively small sum, parties should opt for the most
    cost effective form of ADR.

-   **Control over the outcome.** Parties would have most control over
    the outcome in mediation, as they would be involved in the
    negotiations leading to the settlement and the preparation of the
    terms of the settlement agreement. Conversely, an award made by the
    arbitrator is binding and there is limited scope for appeal with an
    arbitration decision after the award is given.

-   **Maintaining Relationship.** Of the three ADR processes, mediation
    is the least confrontational and combative.

**<span class="underline">COMMUNITY MEDIATION CENTRE (“CMC”)</span>**

1.  **What is the CMC? **

> The Ministry of Law set up the CMC in 1998. Its principal aim is to
> assist Singapore residents in resolving social and community disputes
> in an amicable and effective manner without having to resort to
> litigation (a lawsuit) in the Courts.

1.  **What types of disputes are handled by the CMC?**

> Disputes between neighbours, family members (excluding family
> violence), friends, co-workers, landlords and tenants are suitable for
> mediation at the CMC.
>
> For example: disputes between neighbours arising from noise or
> littering; disputes between family members on care and maintenance
> arrangement for the elderly; displays of unacceptable behaviour
> amongst friends or co-workers; and disagreements between tenants and
> co-tenants on living arrangements. A list of the common categories of
> disputes suitable for CMC can be accessed on the Ministry of Law’s

>
> The CMC does not handle cases that may involve legal and commercial
> issues.

1.  **Who can apply to the CMC for mediation?**

> Any Singapore resident may apply to CMC to initiate the CMC mediation
> process by calling the CMC or submitting an Online Form through the
> CMC’s website: [<span
> class="underline">https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/cmc/en.html</span>](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/cmc/en.html)
>
> Disputes may also be referred to the CMC for voluntary mediation by
> the Police, HDB, Town Council, Members’ of Parliament, Legal Aid
> Bureau or other community-based agency.
>
>  
>
> A Magistrate handling a complaint can also refer suitable cases for
> mediation at the CMC. Mediation is compulsory for such cases.

1.  **What is the CMC’s mediation procedure?**

> After receiving the application from the Applicant, CMC will first
> assess if the dispute is suitable for mediation at the CMC. If it is,
> the CMC will invite the other party (“Respondent”) for mediation.
>
> If the Respondent accepts the invitation, CMC will appoint a mediator
> from its panel of mediators to conduct the mediation session. Both
> parties will sign a mediation agreement before the start of the
> mediation session.
>
> If parties arrive at settlement, a written agreement will be prepared
> and signed by both parties to reflect the terms of the settlement and
> the mediation session will come to an end. The mediator will also
> bring the mediation session to a close if both parties are unable to
> reach a settlement.

Parties in the mediation process cannot be represented by lawyers.

**<span class="underline">NEUTRAL EVALUATION </span>**

1.  **<span class="underline">What types of disputes may be referred to
    Neutral Evaluation?</span>**

> Neutral Evaluation is a form of alternative dispute resolution for
> civil disputes. It is particularly relevant for disputes involving
> technical or specialized subjects such as intellectual property,
> medical negligence, defamation, shipping, banking and finance,
> construction or where the case may turn on expert opinion.
>
> Parties do not have to refer the entire dispute to Neutral Evaluation.
> It is possible for parties to submit only specific critical issues
> that will have a bearing on the outcome of the entire dispute for
> evaluation.

1.  **<span class="underline">How is Neutral Evaluation different to
    Mediation?</span>**

> In Mediation, the mediator assists the parties in negotiating a
> settlement to their dispute. Mediation focuses on finding solutions
> that meet the concerns of both parties, whereas the focus of a Neutral
> Evaluation is in assessing the merits of the parties’ cases.

1.  **<span class="underline">Who can use Neutral Evaluation for
    resolution of disputes?</span>**

> Parties to a civil dispute can use Neutral Evaluation to come to a
> resolution.
>
> Neutral Evaluation is most effective in cases where:

-   There is substantial documentary evidence, e.g. construction-related
    matters.

-   There is conflicting expert evidence and it might be costly and time
    consuming for expert witnesses to testify at length at trial, e.g.
    medical negligence cases.

-   The parties want a neutral person with expert knowledge of the
    subject matter to assess the merits of their case.

-   Both sides believe that they have a strong case and are therefore
    unwilling to explore settlement. A neutral assessment of the
    strengths of each case may be useful to break the deadlock.

1.  **<span class="underline">What is the Neutral Evaluation
    process?</span>**

> The Singapore Mediation Centre (“SMC”) offers a Neutral Evaluation
> service.
>
> Under the SMC, the process is generally as follows:

-   Parties apply to the SMC for Neutral Evaluation.

-   Upon receiving the application, SMC will appoint the Neutral
    Evaluator (usually a Judge).

-   Parties and the Neutral have meetings to decide on the conduct of
    the Neutral Evaluation (e.g. on questions like whether or not the
    two parties want to make the outcome of the Neutral Evaluation
    legally binding).

-   Parties make submissions and/or tender documents to the Neutral
    Evaluator.

-   The Neutral Evaluator will deliver his/her opinion after reviewing
    all the documents and submissions.

> The Neutral Evaluation process is private and confidential. Unlike
> with mediation, the parties are not allowed to meet privately with the
> Neutral Evaluator, so that no private information that could be used
> in making the evaluation flows from one party to the Neutral
> Evaluator.
>
> Parties can also choose whether they want to make the Neutral
> Evaluator’s opinion binding or not, and they can also opt for a
> documents-only evaluation or an evaluation with a hearing.

**40 Engaging a Lawyer**

Laws affect almost every part of your life, and lawyers are trained to
give legal advice and services, and to represent you in Court. Seeing a
lawyer early can save you a lot of time, trouble and money. Lawyers can
provide a range of important and useful services. For example:

-   If you wish to buy or sell a house, your lawyer will advise you of
    the procedures involved, check all documents on your behalf and
    ensure that the title to the house is good.

-   If a family member has passed away, your lawyer will apply to the
    Court so that the possessions and properties of the deceased can be
    passed on according to the law or the dead person’s wishes.

-   If you face a problem with your spouse, your lawyer will advise you
    on the law relating to divorce, separation, maintenance and custody
    of your children.

-   If you have been charged with a criminal offence, or are being sued,
    your lawyer will advise you on matters relating to your defence and
    may represent you in Court.

-   If you have been asked to sign a contract, your lawyer will advise
    you on your rights and duties under the contract, and may suggest
    changes to the wording of the contract to protect your interests.

-   If you are starting a company, social enterprise, or non-profit
    organisation your lawyer will advise you on the best structure for
    running your organisation, and your rights and responsibilities in
    running the organisation.

**THE LAWYER-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP**

You must be able to build a relationship of trust and confidence with
your lawyer.

**Solicitor-client privilege**

Your lawyer has the responsibility to keep your information
confidential. This privilege between solicitor and client is protected
by law and even the Court cannot force a lawyer to reveal conversations
you may have had with him without your permission.

**Your lawyer’s firm**

When you hire a lawyer, you are also hiring the law practice that the
lawyer works for. All members of the law practice and its staff have the
same duties of confidentiality toward you and your matter, as does your
own lawyer.

**Conflict of interest**

Your lawyer owes you a duty to act in your interest and he or she must
avoid any conflict, both real and potential. For example, your lawyer
should not act for another client whose interests are against yours,
such as the party whom you are claiming against. Your lawyer also should
not have any personal interests or involvement in the matter that might
prevent him or her from acting in your best interest. If there is any
potential conflict, the lawyer should inform you and make full
disclosure. If necessary, the lawyer can obtain your informed consent in
writing to allow him or her to act for you despite the conflict or
potential conflict that may arise.

**Your instructions**

Your lawyer will try to understand what you hope to achieve within the
law and the lawyer’s professional duties. Your lawyer cannot follow
instructions from you that would break any law, or breach the lawyer’s
duties to the Court or to the legal profession.

**CHOOSING A LAWYER**

The Ministry of Law has an online directory of the names, addresses and
other useful information of all law practices and practising lawyers in
Singapore. The directory can be accessed at:
<https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/lsra/lsra-home/>.

You can also search the list of law practices that have advertised
specialist practice areas on the Law Society website at:
<http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/forPublic/FindaLawFirmLawyer/FindaLawFirm.aspx>.
But note that the Law Society is not permitted to recommend lawyers to
you.

The recommendations of friends, family and other people who have faced
similar legal or potential problems may also be helpful in your
selection.

To avoid any misunderstanding later on, it may be useful to reach an
early agreement on the legal fees and also have the lawyer give you an
estimate of the expenses likely to be incurred. In addition, you should
be satisfied that your lawyer has the necessary expertise, knowledge and
experience to assist you in your matter. You should also be satisfied
that your lawyer is in a position to give you independent legal advice.
For example a lawyer acting for an opposing party in a dispute you are
involved in cannot represent you except under particular circumstances
with your permission. You may seek a second opinion from another lawyer.

**DUTIES YOUR LAWYER OWES YOU**

Lawyers are required under their professional conduct rules to:

-   Exercise diligence and honesty in their dealings with you;

-   Inform you of matters relating to their legal fees;

-   Provide statements of accounts in a timely manner upon your request;

-   Undertake work in such a manner so as not to unnecessarily or
    improperly escalate their legal fees;

-   Complete any work on your behalf within a reasonable time;

-   Provide you competent representation;

-   Keep you reasonably informed of the progress of your matter;

-   Generally respond to your telephone calls, e-mails and messages
    promptly and keep appointments made with you;

-   Clearly explain proposals of settlements, other offers or positions
    taken by other parties which affect you;

-   Keep your information regarding your matter confidential, even after
    they stop representing you;

-   Act only in your best interests; and

-   Generally evaluate with you if the consequence of your matter
    justifies the expense or the risk involved.

**MEETING YOUR LAWYER**

Before you see your lawyer:

-   Ask your lawyer about the information that he/she needs in advance
    and then proceed to gather as much of it as you can;

-   List the events as they happened;

-   Collate all important papers and supporting documents;

-   List the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of everyone
    involved in your matter; and

-   List the questions or issues you wish to discuss with your lawyer
    during the meeting.

If you have all the necessary information available in an organized
manner, you are likely to spend less time at the meeting with your
lawyer, which would reduce costs.

To avoid future disputes, clarify the likely legal fees involved. Enter
into a proper fee agreement (preferably in writing) that sets out these
charges clearly. Inform your lawyer in advance of any budgetary
constraint on your part. Lawyers usually charge their clients based on
the time that they spend working on their matters (i.e. by hourly
rates). These rates will generally be fixed within the law firm, with
more experienced lawyers charging higher rates than less experienced
lawyers. Some lawyers may be willing to assist you on a fixed-fee basis
(i.e. they agree to charge you a fixed sum, no matter how much time they
actually spend on the work), but this would be subject to negotiation
between you and your lawyer. Also note that if you and your business are
based entirely in Singapore, a lawyer might charge a goods and services
tax (“GST”) at the rate of 7% on top of his or her services rendered.
This is a potential cost you should take into account and you should
clarify this with your lawyer.

When you meet your lawyer:

-   Tell the lawyer everything important;

-   Answer your lawyer’s questions fully, even if you may not understand
    the purpose of the question at the time; and

-   Ask questions to clear all your doubts.

A full and thorough discussion of the issues will help the lawyer give
you a realistic expectation of the prospects for success in what you are
hoping to achieve, as well as a realistic estimate of the fees you can
expect to pay should you proceed. Be mindful that your lawyer may not be
able to give you complete and comprehensive advice at the first meeting.
The law changes often, and your lawyer may need to first check on new
laws or on decisions made by the Court.

**WORKING WITH YOUR LAWYER AFTER THE FIRST MEETING**

Arrange to correspond and have follow-up meetings with your lawyer at
agreed times. Ask for copies of correspondence and documents filed in
Court or regulatory bodies if relevant, and if you do not understand the
documents, have your lawyer explain these.

**Be honest with your lawyer**

It is difficult for your lawyer to give you the best advice if you do
not fully disclose details of your matter and documents as early as
possible and as soon as new issues arise. Any information you tell your
lawyer is confidential under the solicitor-client privilege.

**Manage your expectations**

Your lawyer is not in a position to guarantee that you will succeed, as
many factors are beyond your lawyer’s control. The final decision is
with the Court. Always evaluate your case with your lawyer at regular
intervals and keep an open mind. Remember, your lawyer is not a judge or
government authority.

**Control your legal cost**

Although you need to keep your lawyer fully informed of your matter, do
remember that your lawyer may charge accordingly for his/her time spent
on your matter. Focus your communication with your lawyer on the
essential facts and information of your matter. You may want to ask for
regular fee updates, if the matter is expected to take some time to
resolve. For example, ask your lawyer to update you on the costs
incurred at the end of each week, or when a certain dollar amount has
been exceeded.

**DISPUTES OVER FEES**

The Law Society of Singapore offers a legal costs dispute resolution
scheme, known as “Cost Dispute Resolve”, to assist lawyers, their
clients and third parties to resolve disputes on legal costs amicably
and economically. The scheme provides for mediation as the first step to
resolve such disputes. If mediation is unsuccessful, parties can move on
to the fast and simple arbitration process. More information on the Cost
Dispute Resolve and the applicable rules can be found here:
<http://www.lawsociety.org.sg/forMembers/ResourceCentre/MembershipBenefits/Members%E2%80%99SupportSchemes/CostDisputeResolve.aspx>.

**DISCHARGING YOUR LAWYER’S SERVICES**

You may change your lawyer at any time. However, you should pay any
outstanding costs to your current lawyer before engaging another lawyer
unless there are exceptional reasons for not doing so. Where the
outstanding fees of the current lawyer are not agreed or paid, that
lawyer is entitled to request an undertaking that it retains the
property of your case file (a “lien”).

Your lawyer can discharge himself/herself if:

1.  His/her discharge does not cause significant harm to your interest
    and you are fully informed of the consequences and voluntarily
    assent to it;

2.  Your lawyer reasonably believes that continued engagement in the
    case or matter would likely have a serious adverse effect upon
    his/her health;

3.  You breach an agreement with your lawyer regarding fees or expenses
    to be paid or regarding your conduct;

4.  You make material misrepresentations about the facts of the case or
    matter to your lawyer;

5.  Your lawyer has an interest in the case or matter which is adverse
    to your interest;

6.  Such action is necessary to avoid contravention by your lawyer of
    any legislation; or

7.  Any other good cause exists.

If your lawyer discharges himself/herself, he/she has to take reasonable
care to avoid foreseeable harm to you, including:

1.  Giving due notice to you;

2.  Allowing reasonable time for substitution of a new lawyer;

3.  Co-operating with your new lawyer; and

4.  Subject to the satisfaction of any lien your lawyer may have, paying
    to you any money and handing over all papers and property that you
    are entitled to.

**41 Pro Bono Legal Aid and Assistance for the Community**

A legal problem can cause untold emotional stress and give rise to
tension between family and friends. Often, people have not budgeted for
such emergencies, especially when the family income barely meets daily
expenses. Things are made worse by the fact that legal answers are hard
to come by.

The law is a mystery to many people, with procedures and definitions
that are often confusing and even intimidating. Many people simply
cannot afford to see a lawyer, and as a result seek informal advice from
those around them, often receiving inaccurate information with no way to
verify it.

Even those who wish to extend support to the needy amongst us may need a
helping hand in doing so. Starting and running a non-profit organisation
or a social enterprise is a valiant and very worthy cause, but even here
the legal landscape can be a tricky one to navigate.

However, help is at hand. A number of organisations, including Law
Society Pro Bono Services, provide legal information and assistance to
the community. These agencies and services are listed below, and include
legal clinics and pro bono legal aid in a range of legal matters.

**Law Society Pro Bono Services (“LSPBS”)**

LSPBS is an initiative by the Law Society of Singapore to help bring
free legal assistance to those in need. It is part of the Law Society’s
mission to ensure access to justice.

The work of LSPBS is supported by volunteers who generously and
selflessly give their time and expertise to the needy in the community,
and by financial contributions from individual lawyers, law practices,
private donors, and key stakeholders such as the Ministry of Law, the
State Courts, the Singapore Academy of Law and various community
partners.

Programmes run by LSPBS aim to:

-   Serve the community

-   Support their volunteers

-   Assist or collaborate on pro bono initiatives with other agencies to
    deliver on the Law Society’s mission to ensure access to justice.

LSPBS also runs on-going programmes aimed at delivering legal
information to targeted members of the community, for example, youth and
social enterprises. These initiatives comprise talks, information
booklets, legal clinics and workshops and the like.

More information on these services and various pro bono initiatives by
LSPBS can be found online at the following URL:

1.  **What types of cases are covered by the Community Legal Clinics?**

The Community Legal Clinics (“CLC”) assist Singaporeans and Permanent
Residents facing legal issues on personal matters (investment, business
and professional matters are not covered) and have never sought legal
advice before, and/or are unable afford a lawyer. At the clinics,

20-minute, one-to-one consultation session with a qualified lawyer. It
is the first port of call to seek free basic legal advice and
information.

Basic advice is available for personal matters only (i.e. not meant for
business/corporate or professional enquiries), including:

-   Criminal matters;

-   Matrimonial matters like divorce, adoptions, claims for maintenance,
    > custody of children and separation;

-   Employment matters like wrongful dismissals;

-   Tenancy disputes;

-   Monetary claims;

-   Motor and industrial accident claims; and

-   Probate (wills, trusts and estate) matters.

1.  **What types of cases does the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme cover?**

The Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (“CLAS”) provides criminal legal
assistance to the poor and needy who are unable to afford a lawyer, and
are facing charges in a Singapore court for non-death
penalty offences under statutes covered by CLAS.

CLAS covers offences under the following statutes:

 

-   Arms & Explosives Act (Cap. 13)

-   Arms Offences Act (Cap. 14)

-   Computer Misuse Act (Cap. 50A)

-   Corrosive & Explosive Substances & Offensive Weapons Act (Cap. 65)

-   Dangerous Fireworks Act (Cap. 72)

-   Enlistment Act (Cap. 93)

-   Explosive Substances Act (Cap. 100)

-   Films Act (Cap. 107)

-   Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap. 184)

-   Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185)

-   Moneylender's Act (Cap. 188) \[Sections 14 & 28\]

-   Penal Code (Cap. 224)

-   Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap. 241)

-   Undesirable Publications Act (Cap. 338)

-   Vandalism Act (Cap. 341)

-   Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) \[Sections 65(8) and 140(1)(i)\]

1.  **Who is eligible to apply for assistance under CLAS?**

To qualify for CLAS assistance, the applicant must:

1.  Reside in Singapore (open to both locals and foreigners);

2.  Be charged in Court for an offence under one of the statutes listed
    above; and

3.  Pass both the Means Test and a Merits Test.

***Means Test***

Under the means test, persons with a disposable income of not more than
$10,000 per annum and a disposable capital of not more than $10,000 may
be granted legal aid.

“*Disposable Income*” means the applicant’s income together with the
income (if any) of the spouse, during the period of 12 months
immediately before the date of the application, after deducting:

1.  $6,000 for the applicant;

2.  $6,000 for the working spouse;

3.  Up to $6,000 for each dependant;

4.  An amount not exceeding $20,000 for rent (if any);

5.  The applicant’s contribution to the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”);

6.  The spouse’s contribution to the CPF.

“*Disposable Capital*” means the applicant’s property, excluding:

1.  The applicant’s clothes;

2.  Things the applicant needs for work;

3.  Household furniture;

4.  The house the applicant lives in, but only if it has an annual value
    of not more than $13,000 or is a Housing and Development Board (HDB)
    flat;

5.  Savings up to $30,000, only if the applicant is 60 years of age or
    above;

6.  The applicant’s CPF;

7.  Up to $46,000 of the total surrender value of the applicant’s life
    insurance policies.

***Merits Test***

After the applicant has completed the Means Test, the applicant will
also need to pass a Merits Test, meaning CLAS will have to decide
whether giving the applicant a lawyer would help the applicant’s case.
In order to determine this, a lawyer (called a Lead Lawyer) will ask the
applicant questions regarding the applicant’s case. The Lead Lawyer may
also give the applicant some preliminary legal advice on the matter, as
well as preliminary advice on the procedures moving forward with regard
to the matter.

1.  **How much are the legal fees under CLAS?**

If the application is successful, the volunteer lawyer will not charge
any fees for his/her services. However, he/she may ask the applicant for
out of pocket expenses such as the costs of obtaining police statements,
reports and transportation.

Depending on the results of the Means Test, the applicant may need to
pay CLAS a co-payment amount before the applicant can be assigned a
lawyer. The applicants will be advised how if they are required to make
any payment to CLAS when they are informed of the outcome of their
application.

1.  **How can I register for CLAS?**

The applicant must apply in person at the CLAS office. If the person
needing legal help is in remand, they can apply through prison.

    maintenance of ex-wife and children, division of assets and
    properties)

1.  **Who is eligible for LAB assistance?**

To qualify for LAB assistance, the applicant must:

1.  Be a Singapore Citizen or a Singapore Permanent Resident;

2.  Pass the Means Test, i.e. the applicant’s disposable income (that
    is, income for the past 12 months before the date of application for
    legal aid and after deducting prescribed allowances) must not exceed
    $10,000, and the disposable capital must not exceed $10,000; and

3.  Pass the Merits Test, i.e. there must be merits or reasonable
    grounds for granting aid in the circumstances of the case.

The Director of Legal Aid has limited discretion, under certain
extraordinary conditions, to extend legal aid to applicants who do not
satisfy the Means Test.

1.  **How much does LAB assistance cost?**

A person receiving legal aid (representation in court) from LAB may be
required to pay a contribution towards the costs of work done for him in
his case, and pay a deposit to be used towards out-of-pocket expenses
(e.g. cost of medical report, advertisements fees) incurred on his
behalf. The contribution payable depends on the financial means of the
applicant, the nature of his case, the amount of work done and the
amount of money recovered for him.

1.  **Registration**

The applicant has to go to LAB during office hours to make an
application. If applicant is below 21 years of age, a parent or guardian
must apply on his/her behalf. The applicant must bring his/her Identity

1.  **What types of cases does the Community Justice Centre cover?**

The Community Justice Centre (“CJC”) is a community partnership between
the public sector, the philanthropic sector, and the legal profession to
assist Litigants-in-Person (“LIP”s) in need.

General services include:

1.  Legal Services

2.  Information on court processes

3.  Practical Support (for LiPs)

4.  Social & Referral Services

***Primary Justice Project (“PJP”) for Family and Civil cases***

The Primary Justice Project (“PJP”) is a programme administered by the
CJC, which encourages the disputing parties to explore amicable
settlements before taking legal action in court.

Under this scheme, a party who has a dispute may approach any lawyer
listed on the Primary Justice panel. These lawyers provide basic legal
services geared towards resolving the disputes at an early stage.

This scheme is particularly suitable for the following types of cases:

1.  Civil claims of less than $60,000 and which fall outside the Small
    Claims Tribunals' jurisdiction, including consumer claims, tenancy
    disputes, Management Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) disputes
    (e.g. condominiums), defamation and employment disputes.

2.  Divorce matters where most ancillary matters are close to
    settlement.

3.  Harassment (wef 1 April 2017).

***Primary Justice Project’s Criminal Case Management System (“CCMS”)
and***

***Criminal Case Resolution (“CCR”) for Criminal cases***

The Criminal Case Management System (“CCMS”) involves a meeting between
the prosecutors and an accused person’s defence counsel to explore the
key issues in dispute or engage in plea-bargaining.

The Criminal Case Resolution (“CCR”) involves a meeting between a senior
district judge, the prosecutors and the accused person’s defence counsel
with a view to facilitating a mutual understanding of disputed issues in
the case and, where appropriate, give an indication of the likely
sentence upon conviction or a plea of guilt.

The CCMS and CCR are important plea-bargaining processes between accused
persons and the prosecution, but they are only opened to accused persons
who are represented by a defence counsel.

The PJP (CCMS/CCR) provides a lawyer who will make representation on
behalf of the applicant during the CCMS and CCR process. This will
include at least one round of written or oral representation to the
prosecutors. The applicant may also retain the services of the lawyer
(at fees to be agreed) if he/she chooses to proceed on to trial or to
plead guilty.

1.  **Who is eligible for the PJP’s CCMS and CCR processes?**

Only criminal cases are eligible for the PJP’s CCMS and CCR processes.
Applicants must also have an annual disposable income of S$12,000 or
less.

1.  **How much does the CJC charge for their services?**

The CJC’s general services are available free of charge.

However, for PJP applications, payment must be made before any legal
services can be provided. The cost structure is as follows:

<span class="underline">Consultation (non-refundable)</span>

\-       $300 legal fees

\-       $100 administrative fees

<span class="underline">Legal fees (up to 5 hours)</span>

\-       $1,500 (at a rate of $300 per hour)

This includes disbursements. However:

-   Does not include costs and disbursements payable to an alternative
    dispute resolution (“ADR”) service provider (e.g. mediation
    provider), stamp fees and other fees payable to third parties

-   If legal service rendered is less than 5 hours, the cost of the
    > remaining hours based on the lawyer’s submitted timesheet will be
    > refunded.

**Types of cases covered by MSC**

The Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations’ Maintenance Support
Central (“MSC”) has a Multi-Service Drop-In Centre that provides support
and assistance for clients who have difficulty in receiving spousal
and/or child maintenance.

Services include:

1.  ***Enforcement of Court Orders relating to maintenance/ fresh
    Applications for Maintenance***

    MSC provides video-link facilities to assist with electronically
    filing enforcement proceedings and fresh applications for
    maintenance, in order to reduce the number of court attendances.

2.  ***Credit Bureau Reporting for defaults in maintenance payments***

> MSC assists with the filing of maintenance debts to the credit bureau,
> which will record and share this information with its member
> companies. This acts as deterrence for future defaults in maintenance
> payments as it reflects poorly on one’s credit report, hence affects
> ease in completing financial transactions.

1.  ***Legal Clinics - Family Law***

    Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations runs Civil Law and Muslim
    Law Legal Clinics to assist women residing in Singapore who are
    facing family law issues. The volunteer lawyers provide general
    guidance and advice on matters relating to divorce, maintenance,
    personal protect orders, custody/access etc. A means test will be
    applied.

2.  ***Counselling***

    MSC also offers professional counselling services to provide
    guidance and support. Payment is set on a sliding scale based on
    Applicant’s income:

**FOR COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS**

Charitable or not-for-profit arts organisations may qualify for pro bono
legal advice and assistance on corporate transactional matters.

**Community Organisations Clinics**

Law Society Pro Bono Services runs Community Organisation Clinics
(“COC”) to assist organisations in Singapore with an objective to meet
community concerns by providing basic legal advice on operational
issues.

Applicants must be:

1.  A social enterprise or non-profit organisation (e.g. a charity or
    voluntary welfare organisation) based in Singapore;

2.  Geared towards meeting community concerns or needs (i.e. beneficial
    to the community in Singapore as a whole, and not confined to
    sectional interests or group of persons based on race, creed, belief
    or religion);

3.  In need of basic legal advice and information on operational issues.

Each session usually lasts for about 45 minutes. Advice given is of a
general and preliminary nature. The COCs do not offer legal
representation to the applicants, although LSPBS may be able to assist
with providing you information on how to engage a lawyer formally.

**Project Law Help**

LSPBS’ Project Law Help programme matches eligible community-serving
organisations with law firms that are willing to provide free
non-litigation commercial legal services.

These legal services could include:

-   Corporate law (E.g. advice on contracts with suppliers, indemnity
    agreements for corporate sponsors, drafting pledges for donors);

-   Employment law (E.g. drafting or reviewing employment contracts);

-   Intellectual property law (E.g. advice on copyright, data
    protection, website use);

-   Property law (E.g. advice on lease terms); and

-   Other legal matters not involving court litigation advice or
    representation.

Applicants must be:

1.  A local social enterprise or non-profit organisation (e.g. a charity
    or voluntary welfare organisation) based in Singapore;

2.  Geared towards meeting community concerns or needs (i.e. beneficial
    to the community in Singapore as a whole, and not confined to
    sectional interests or group of persons based on race, creed, belief
    or religion);

3.  In need of legal advice or representation for a corporate
    non-litigation matter or a transaction concerning the organisation;

4.  With limited or no financial resources to pay for such legal advice
    or representation.

Successful applicants work directly with the law firm assigned, with the
assurance that all legal matters will be handled in professional
confidence by the volunteer law practice. Do note that eligibility for
Project Law Help involves the application of a means test by LSPBS to
determine the financial status of applicants. To this end, you would
need to forward certain financial information in respect of your social
enterprise to LSPBS in order for this determination to be made. All such
information forwarded will be kept confidential.
